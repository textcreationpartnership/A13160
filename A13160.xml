            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT honorable Sir <hi>Robert Cecill</hi> Knight.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He publike affaires of this State, right honourable, depending ſo much upon your counſell and direction, I ſhould not onely wrong you, but others alſo, and forget my ſelfe, if I ſhould either holde you with any long diſcourſe, or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune you with the hearing of a priuate quarrell betwixt me and a certeine baſe and vnworthy aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, whoſe pleaſure is to contend with me about certeine ſmall quirks and queſtions. It may alſo ſeeme a matter vnwoorthie your place and perſon, to offer vnto you a ſmall treatiſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo ſmall trifles, the aduerſaries whole diſcourſe, which I anſwere, being ſpent about certeine pretended vntrueths and falſifications, wherewith he would gladly charge me, if he could. Yet foraſmuch as this controuerſie grew firſt out of a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge made by me ſome two yeeres ſince to <hi>Robert Parſons,</hi> a man, rather for his hatred to the State, and treacherie against his Souereigne, than for learning, vertue, or pietie, knowen to many: and ſeeing the author of this quarrell now hath enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me to diſcuſſe ſome points both of Religion, and State, not vnprofitable to be well vnderſtood; I haue made bolde to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this treatiſe enſuing, that conteineth not onely my former challenge, but alſo an anſwere to my aduerſaries friuolous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections, to your Honors hands.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:18442:3"/>
            <p>The whole is diuided into diuers chapters, of which diuers doe conteine intire diſcourſes, whereof you may chuſe, and reade one or more, as your great occaſions, and laiſure will permit. and none there is, I hope, ſo barren, but it may yeeld ſome fruit. But if it may pleaſe your Honor to peruſe the whole, you ſhall then better vnderſtand, not onely the occaſions of this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, but alſo the iuſtice of our cauſe, and the vaine cauils, which our aduerſaries make againſt vs, for want of better matter, when as we without all circumloquution charge them with hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie and falſhood in matter of religion; and diſloyalty and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery in matter of State.</p>
            <p>Your Honor ſhall alſo thereby perceiue the great weakneſſe of our aduerſaries cauſe, and the pouertie of the principall actors in the ſame, who abandoning the maine points in controuerſie, begin now to picke quarrels, at words, allegations, points, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and other by-matters, and ceaſing to ioine with vs, and like Diuines to argue, and diſpute, fall to plaine calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and railing. for hauing ſome yeeres paſt written diuers treatiſes, not onely againſt <hi>Robert Parſons,</hi> but alſo againſt <hi>Robert Bellarmine</hi> the chiefe Patriarke now of all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and hauing publiſhed a challenge againſt <hi>Rob. Parſons,</hi> and proued, that his conſorts the Papiſts are neither good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, nor yet true Subiects; yet do I not finde any, that dare encounter me hand to hand, nor haue I receiued any anſwere to any purpoſe, nor haue I yet encountred any, that hath oppoſed himſelfe to any diſcourſe or argument of mine. <hi>Parſons,</hi> he is content to be ſilent, and he that hath put foorth the pamphlet called <hi>The detection,</hi> albeit he could not holde his peace, yet could he not ſay much, being of the number of thoſe idle fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, <hi>qui nec tacere, nec rectè fari poſſunt.</hi> he doth onely except againſt certaine allegations, and by-matters, and quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of my challenge; but the diſcourſe it ſelfe, and the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions thereof were either too heauy for him to lift, or too hot for ſo frigide and maleficiat a fellow to touch.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:18442:3"/>
            <p>If then law doth iuſtly praeſume him to be guiltie, that being arreigned at the barre ſtandeth mute; then is it not to be prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, that either <hi>Rob.

            <p>Furthermore, if in the very places, where my aduerſarie thought to winne greateſt aduantage, he hath gotten nothing, but rather ſhewed his owne ignorance &amp; malice; I hope all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different men will well allow of the reſt, and grant, that I haue vſed more than ordinary circumſpection in this labour. for doe what a man can, yet may either marginall notes be miſplaced, or words ſtand diſorderly, or things be miſtaken. Finally, if to anſwere the aduerſaries obiections, and to encounter him in his turne, I ſhalbe able to charge not onely <hi>Bellarmine, Baronius, Parſons</hi> and ſuch like meane fellowes, but alſo the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe &amp; the Church of Rome with vntrueths and falſifications, which can not be anſwered; then Gods iuſtice will appeare, that hath brought them <hi>into the pit, which they digged for others,</hi> and I hope they will henceforth forbeare to charge me, and other honeſt men <hi>with lies, and falſifications,</hi> finding themſelues moſt guiltie, and vs in reſpect of themſelues most innocent. Of all men the detector ſhall haue leaſt reaſon to make a challenge concerning vntrueth and falſifications being able to anſwere nothing in a <note n="b" place="margin">In an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the Papiſts ſtand charged with diuers falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and yet diſſemble the whole matter.</note> cauſe, where he is defendant, nor able to iuſtifie that pamphlet, which himſelfe hath publiſhed.</p>
            <p>But of all theſe matters your Honor ſhall then be able beſt to iudge, when you ſhall haue read the diſcourſe enſuing, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared his exceptions with my challenge, and my anſwere with his vaine exceptions. all which I doe preſent to your Honor, as much eſteeming your iudgement in ſuch caſes, and deſiring to
<pb facs="tcp:18442:4"/> haue my cauſe heard and tried by men of ſuch integritie, and iudgement, and little weighing the vaine cauils of others, if my labors be approued by men of ſuch grauitie and wiſdome.</p>
            <p>The worke as far as it concerneth my aduerſaries excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is not great, nor the controuerſie betwixt mine aduerſarie and me materiall. but the fault was not mine, but his, whoſe trifling pamphlet at this time gaue mee no better ſubiect to worke vpon. yet this profit may the readers reape by it, that they ſhall hereafter not need to feare either the vaine brags, or great words, and titles which the Papiſts do arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſeeing they are demasked, and declared neither to be true catholicks nor loiall ſubiects, if they hold the grounds of Popery.</p>
            <p>But whatſoeuer this treatiſe is, or may effect, I beſeech your Honor to accept it as a token of his deuotion, that is a member of that Vniuerſitie, whereof you are Chancellor. and as you do ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed your worthy father in that place, ſo I beſeech God, that you may not only ſucceed him, but alſo ſurpaſſe him, if it be poſsible, in his zeale and pious care to aduance true religion, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. During his time, although none of Baals prieſts durſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looke into the Vniuerſitie, or ſhew himſelfe abroad in this realme, yet did they ſecretly keepe in corners. but by your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors care and vigilancy, according to her Maieſties late Edict, we do hope to ſee them not onely repreſſed, but alſo quite expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and returned to him that ſent them.</p>
            <p>What their errors are, and what they deſerue, it may in part appeare by this treatiſe. the reſt we refer to thoſe, whom it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth. And ſo loth to interrupt the courſe of your more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous congitations and actions, I end, beſeeching the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to bleſſe you with his heauenly graces, and as he hath vſed you hitherto, as a notable inſtrument to aduance religion, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and iuſtice, ſo to grant, that all that loue true religion, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and iuſtice may long enioy your helpe and fauor.</p>

            <head>The Preface to all indifferent Readers, wherein not only the purpoſe of this treatiſe is declared, but alſo diuers points of the aduerſaries Preface and firſt chapter, that fell not within the compaſſe of any order, examined and refuted.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the quarrels and cavils of falſe teachers and haeretikes, gentle reader, proceed from the fountaine of their malice, and are ſet forward by the ſuggeſtions of ſatan, who by all meanes endevoureth to trouble the peace of gods church, and to ſhake the faith of ſuch weaklings, as are not firmely built vpon the immooueable rocke Chriſt Ieſus: yet it pleaſeth God oftentimes, by his vnſearchable wiſdome, to diſpoſe mens evill purpoſes and actions to his great glory, and the aduancement of religion, &amp; the great good of his church, which thoſe men thought to ruinate. <hi>Etiam ſic veris illis catholicis membris Chriſti malo ſuo proſunt</hi> ſaith Saint <note n="a" place="margin">Lib. 18. de ciuit. dei. c. 51.</note> 
               <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> ſpeaking of haeretickes, that contumaciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the trueth, and ſeeke to defend their peſtilent and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked opinions. Whereof although I had no great experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before this time; yet now by the friuolous, and vaine cauils of a certaine corner-creeping diſciple of antichriſt againſt my late challenge made to <hi>Robert Parſons,</hi> diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:18442:5"/> vnder the maske of two letters, and calling himſelfe <hi>N. D.</hi> I finde to be moſt true. For whereas heeretofore my challenge was not knowne to many, and now beganne to be forgotten of ſuch, as firſt had read it. I doubt not, but this vaine cauiller, by his vaine exceptions will cauſe the ſame to be both more diligently read, and better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, than it was like to be otherwiſe. for I doe not beleeue, that any man will offer me that wrong, that he will condemne me, before he hath both read, what I haue written, &amp; examined the matters wherewith I am charged.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe he hath alledged, that I deliver out matters upon mine owne credit, &amp; without proofe, I have taken occaſion to peruſe my former challenge, &amp; to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſame with divers authorities and arguments, and ſo to publiſh it: aſſuring thee if any thing now want proofe, that it is of that nature, that it is of it ſelfe moſt euident, and needeth no proofe, being either knowen publikely, or confeſſed by the aduerſaries themſelues.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this miſerable fellow, that maketh himſelfe partie againſt me, ſeemeth rather to betray the cauſe of the papiſts then otherwiſe. For taking vpon him to debate ſome matters in my late challenge, he is neither able to contradict my arguments, whereby I prooued, that the papiſts were neither catholicks, nor the true church, nor mainteined the old Chriſtian faith, nor hath he abilitie to diſcharge his conſorts of the crimes of haereſie and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, wherewith they ſtand charged, and now by his ſilence ſeeme to be conuicted. So that I doubt not, but if the pope may vnderſtand, and be well informed of this prating fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes treacherous dealing in his cauſe, that he will either puniſh him, as a falſe traitor to his See, or at the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund him to ſilence as a weake ideot, and fooliſh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in matter of religion.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, he doth greatly grace my writings againſt
<pb facs="tcp:18442:5"/> his father <hi>Robert Parſons:</hi> for if he be not able to except againſt more places then ſixe and twenty, or thereabout: it is cleare, that I haue ſaid true in the reſt, and that I haue argued, and alledged authorities to good purpoſe. For if I had offended, I doubt not but I ſhould haue heard of it. And becauſe you ſhal not ſuſpect that theſe are but ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, rather than firme concluſions; I doe before hand tell you, that this vaine bangler will not hereafter vndertake to anſwer my challenge from argument to argument, allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to allegation, teſtimony to teſtimony. Behold then ô miſerable papiſts, your poore diſtreſſed proctor, and let the cacolike <hi>conuertite</hi> ſiſters relieue him with ſome good words of comfort, that in his needleſſe quarrell hath ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne himſelfe and his cauſe, and hath done me more fauour, than I ſhall be willing to requite him in haſte.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, he doth diſcouer the vanitie of his owne bragges in his moſt miſerable pleading. <hi>I require no more learning,</hi> ſaith <note n="b" place="margin">Detect. Ch. 1. p. 8.</note> he, <hi>then the vnderſtanding of Latin; no more labour, than to open the books, &amp; view the places quoted; no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, then that the tongue can truly report, what the heart thinketh:</hi> and yet when it commeth to the iumpe, with all that little learning he hath, and withall his labour could he not faſten any one vntrueth, or falſification vpon me; as ſhall ſufficiently appeere by my anſwer. beſide that, it is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to talke of learning and vnderſtanding of Latin, when in moſt of the places by him touched, I ſpeake Engliſh, and alledge not the fathers words. in the reſt it will appeare, that his prouiſion of Latin is not ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant. this ſentence therefore he hath tranſlated out of the pretended biſhop of Eureux his diſcourſe, although it fit not his purpoſe in any ſort.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, He is a very vaine fellow to demand of vs ſuch a conference, as paſſed in France. for well might he haue ſeene, if he had not wilfully ſhut his eies, that the caſe is
<pb facs="tcp:18442:6"/> not like: and the reaſons he might have vnderſtood, if he had not bene ſenceleſſe, they being ſo plainly laid downe in my refutation of his father <hi>Robert parſons</hi> his calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous relation ſent vs from Rome (very wiſely) of matters done in France. Further he might well haue remembred, if he had not bene forgetfull, that I offred the papiſts more then was demanded, for I did not onely promiſe to deale with <hi>Parſons,</hi> or any of his conſortes in any priuate confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but alſo in publicke writing, which might not onely be viewed of all men, but alſo remaine to poſterity as a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony againſt thoſe, that ſhould be conuinced either of vntrueth or forgery, and which being extant in print nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we, nor our aduerſaries ſhould be able to alter, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or miſreport any thing, that is written, as is the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courſe of Popiſh Paraſits in ſuch conferences, and to ſhew, that I meant to performe as much, as I promiſed, I began to obiect certain epiſtles and canons forged not by ſuch baſe thred-bare companions, as himſelfe, but by the popes and church of Rome. I ſhewed alſo, that they had falſified the ſcriptures, and publiſhed infinit and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous lies in their legends read publickly in the church. finally I put <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> in minde of the notorious clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and corrupting of fathers of late practiſed by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts by their rubarbatif and expurgatorie indexes. but he like a wiſe fellow kept himſelfe cloſe and would no more heare of the matter, thinking it was better, as the old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe teacheth, in this <hi>Carian</hi> to make triall of this hard aduenture, and <hi>to</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe, <hi>In care periculum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cito:</hi> teacheth that in baſe fellowes it is beſt to trie dangerous experiments.</note> 
               <hi>thruſt this aſſe downe headlong from the rockes,</hi> knowing well, that if we ſhould ouercome him, or come to the taking of him up, we ſhould finde nothing but the carcaſe of a dead aſſe. wherefore then is our adverſary ſo deſirous of a conference, that doubteth to trie his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in iuſtifying his friends falſhood and forgery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning matters already laid to their charge? <note n="d" place="margin">Protruſit aſinum in ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes. Horat. ep.</note> againe when he ſeeth our readines to anſwer, why is he ſo ſlow to obiect?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:18442:6"/>
            <p>Finally where he thinketh to triumpth moſt gloriouſly and to leade my brother <hi>Willet,</hi> and me both captiues and faſt chained at the taile of his chariot, there he doth moſt pitifully diſgrace himſelfe, and free vs, and marre all that he medleth withall.</p>
            <p>For firſt ſpeaking of falſifications, he compareth them to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſuch mens incredulity, as will not beleeue him, he compareth to the incredulity of <hi>Thomas,</hi> that would not beleeue Chriſtes reſurrection, before he ſaw and felt manifeſt ſignes of it. <hi>the ſentences alledged out of fathers and other authors,</hi> ſaith <note n="c" place="margin">Praeſ. fol. 5.</note> he, <hi>be ſo mangled and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med &amp;c. as no protestant, I am ſure will beleeue, vntill fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſeeing with Saint Thomas convince his incredulity.</hi> is not this a braue gallant then, trow you, that compareth trueth to falſhood, the feeling of Chriſt to the feeling of falſifications?</p>
            <p>Secondly where the maine controuerſy betwixt me and <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> in my challenge, is concerning the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and where this blinde baiard might ſee, that I haue alledged diuers ſtrong reaſons to prooue, that the congregation of <hi>Romaniſtes</hi> under the pope and cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, is not the true church of Chriſt, there, all this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, my adverſarie ſmoothly diſſembleth the matter, and taketh that as granted, which he poore fellow can neuer prooue, and ſaith, <hi>that my</hi> brother <hi>Willet,</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Fol. 1. praef.</note> and I <hi>imploy our forces in aſſaulting the impregnable ſort of gods church, and battring that rocke, againſt which the gates of hell ſhall not preuaile.</hi> as if the congregation of the malignant, and wicked rable of antichriſt could be the true church of Chriſt, or as if the gates of hell had not long ſince prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt the pope and church of Rome. our aduerſary therefore taking this for granted, that is the controuerſy, if without controverſy I haue not demonſtrated, that the church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the true church, ſheweth, that he is
<pb facs="tcp:18442:7"/> pregnant with folly, of which he will not be deliuered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he die, &amp; that his face is as hard as the rocke, of which he talketh.</p>
            <p>Thirdly he calleth popiſh religion <hi>Catholicke,</hi> and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <note n="f" place="margin">Fol. 2. praef.</note> 
               <hi>it was planted here by Gregory the great, who by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion receiued it from Peter, &amp;c, and that it was alwaies viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſince Chriſt bearing ſtill ſaile in the tempeſts of all perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> but he ſhould doe well, to ſhew how true religion can be viſible. for our ſaviour Chriſt ſaith, <note n="g" place="margin">Iohn 4.</note> 
               <hi>that true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipers worſhip God in ſpirit and truth.</hi> but ſpirituall worſhip and true internall deuotion is not ſo eaſily ſeene. unleſſe therefore our adverſary ſuppoſe popiſh religion to conſiſt in the popes mitre, and in coules of monkes, and ſuch like externall matters; he ſhal hardly proue religion to be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Againe, he doth greatly wrong the popiſh cauſe, if he affirme popiſh religion to have bene planted here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by <hi>Gregory,</hi> and be not able to anſwer my challenge, and to demonſtrate thoſe novelties, and late receiued fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which I have mentioned, either to haue beene taught by <hi>Gregory,</hi> or at the leaſt by his diſciples to haue beene planted here in England. Furthermore, ſeeing in my chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge I doe prooue, <hi>that popiſh religion is not catholike,</hi> and giue for iuſtification of that point notable inſtances, ſuch as our aduerſary ſhall not be able to anſwer; is it not noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious impudency, to take this, as a matter either prooued, or confeſſed, and ſlily to call haereſie catholike religion? finally, I muſt entreat ſome plaine dealing papiſt to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh this detector, or rather detractor of ours, not to ſay, that <hi>Gregory</hi> receiued the popiſh religion, that now is mainteined by the pope of Rome, and was firſt eſtabliſhed in the conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> from <hi>Peter;</hi> or that all, that is taught in <hi>Gregories</hi> dialogues, or epiſtles came from <hi>Peter;</hi> or that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church, that now is viſible in the pope, cardinals, monkes, and ſwarmes of friers, and in Romiſh
<pb facs="tcp:18442:7"/> ceremonies, <hi>hath borne ſaile in the tempeſts of all perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> for it is the pope, and his bloody inquiſitors, that do perſecute others, and are not perſecuted. and if this be a qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ty of the church, <hi>to beare ſaile in tempeſts of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> certes the pope and his retinue cannot be the true church, that for many hundred yeeres have lived in all pompe, iolitie, and pleaſure. but if the Romiſh church be ſo well able to beare ſaile in tempeſts, it were much to be wiſhed, that the pope and his cardinals would ſaile to the Indiaes, where we might heare no more of them, and that they would take our aduerſary with them, who percaſe would prooue a better ſwabber, then a diſputer.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In the beginning of his Praeface, he ſaith, <hi>he will preſent to his readers view a repreſentation, or liuely pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of a conference, that is, notable vntrueths and falſificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c.</hi> and theſe alſo he auoucheth he will gather out of maſter <hi>Willets,</hi> and my writings. wherein I would pray all moderate papiſts to conſider with indifferency this fond ſpeech of this moſt miſerable popiſh creature and proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. he calleth <hi>notable untrueths and falſifications a paterne of ſuch a conference,</hi> as he deſireth. If then he deſire a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, he muſt needs deſire vntrueths and falſifications, if his words haue any ſence. I know, he hopeth to picke them out of our writings. but if he finde any, they muſt be ſuch, as are vttered by himſelfe, and his conforts, and not by vs. in the meane while his fellowes are ſory to ſee him ſpeake ſo fooliſhly of conferences, vntrueths, and falſificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, He <note n="e" place="margin">Fol. 1. praef.</note> talketh alſo verie idelly <hi>of backe dores, and deceitfull entries, ſuch as</hi> Daniel <hi>detected in</hi> Bels <hi>idolatrous prieſts.</hi> which, if I did not know the mans great ſimplicity, I would haue imagined to haue beene foiſted into his Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face by ſome backe friend to popiſh religion, to the great diſgrace of Romiſh prieſts, that by backe dores, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
<pb facs="tcp:18442:8"/> entries play many lewd parts with their nonnes in Spaine and Italy, and with recuſants wiues, maides, and daughters, where they are lodged and interteined in England, as ſhall be prooved by particulars, if any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to aske me the queſtion. Theſe alſo doe worſhip idoles as brutiſhly as the <note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> 14. in the Latin tranſlation.</note> 
               <hi>Babylonians</hi> did <hi>Bel,</hi> and ſet vp the images of ſaint <hi>Anthony,</hi> and ſaint <hi>Dominicke</hi> and other ſaints vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on altars, as the <hi>Babylonians</hi> did their god <hi>Bel.</hi> finally they burne incenſe to their idoles, and crouch to them, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſacrifices before them, as the idolatrous prieſts did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bel.</hi> There reſteth therefore nothing to make them all like to <hi>Bels</hi> prieſts, but, now their fraudes and couſinages and idolatries and impieties are diſcouered, that ſome ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous prince would doe with the popiſh prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> in England and other places, as the king of <hi>Babylon</hi> did with the prieſts of Bel in his country. and that would make an end both of the whole controuerſy, and of this idle fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes brabling.</p>
            <p>6 Likewiſe under the title of his booke hee ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe this verſe. <note n="g" place="margin">

I haue not ſent them, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, nor ſpoken to them. they propheſie unto you a lying viſion, and diuination, and fraud, and the deceipt of there owne heart.</hi> whereby it ſeemeth he was hired, to ſpeake ſhame and reproch of his owne moſt lewd companions, comming directly from antichriſt, and not from Chriſt; of the church of Rome, that in liew of Gods word readeth fables and lying legends; and of the pope, that in his lying decretales brocheth the deceits of his owne heart, neither can this propheſie be expounded of any ſo fitly, as of the falſe prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> that come with faculties from the pope without any one word of authority, or lawful miſſion from God; and that propheſie lying viſions of the reſtoring of the idolatrous religion of papiſts, and preach the fancies
<pb facs="tcp:18442:8"/> and deceits of there owne hearts, out of their maſters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>turall and falſe dictates. I know he aimeth at vs. but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing choſen this ſentence for an ornament of the front of his lying pamphlet, he muſt be content to take it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and muſt for any helpe he ſhall haue of vs, neceſſarily be forced to apply it to his friends, where it is beſt deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
            <p>7 Talking of ſupoſed falſifications he ſaith, <hi>three things make a falſary: first changing of the trueth into falſhood, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly craft and malice, and laſtly domage or hurt.</hi> and to proue his words true, he alledgeth the names of <hi>Hostienſis and Panormitan:</hi> two ancient canoniſtes. but vnleſſe he acquit himſelfe the better, in talking of falſification it will be proued, that he hath falſely alledged theſe two authors. no man certes euer talked more ſimply of falſity, and falſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, then this falſary. for, not either change of trueth into falſhood, is falſity, no albeit it be craftily done, &amp; with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to ſome perſon (for then ſhould euery malicious and hurtfull liar be a falſary alſo; and the authours and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouers of the Romiſh legends and breuiaries ſhould alſo be notorious falſaries, hauing told many groſſe malicious lies to the great ſlander and hurt of religion) nor hath our aduerſary rightly defined a falſary. for a falſary is he, that in writings addeth or detracteth, or altereth any thing fraudulently, as appeareth by the gloſſe <hi>in c. in memoriam. dist.</hi> 19. and as the Romaniſtes ſhew themſelves to be by their expurgatory indexes. but ſaith our detractor in the margent, <hi>in the french copy printed by Hierome Verduſſen</hi> it is ſo. but this is contrary to the text. beſide that, we are no more ro beleeue the print of <hi>Hierome Verduſſen,</hi> then of <hi>Iulian Greeneſleue.</hi> if our aduerſary will make ſuch crakes, he muſt bring vs better authours then <hi>Hierome Verduſſen,</hi> or the popiſh reporter of the conference betwixt M. <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu,</hi> and <hi>Eureux.</hi> is it then likely, that our aduerſary ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:18442:9"/> conuince vs of falſification, that albeit himſefe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth many groſſe falſifications, yet knoweth not what this word meaneth? which may alſo appeare in this, that he chargeth me with falſification in the firſt and ſecond place noted page. 47. &amp; 51. where I doe not ſo much as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any writing, or any mans words, but onely quote <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in the margent, to ſhew that my aſſertion may be proued out of their writings.</p>
            <p>8 His metaphors, and profound allegoricall ſpeeches he vſeth to draw from womens rocks. <hi>as though</hi> ſaith he, <hi>he had not towe inough to his rocke.</hi> which ſheweth that this companion is better ſeene in womens rockes and frockes, then in any point of diuinity. beware therefore you of the cacolicke crew, that ſuch gallants come not neere your wiues, daughters, nor maids, that they play not with you a tricke of their cacolicke religion, if you beleeue not me, beleeue <hi>Palingenius,</hi> that would haue ſuch mates excluded out of mens houſes, that meane to keepe their women chaſt.</p>
            <p>9 And although this is the mans great ſimplicity and weakneſſe; yet would he needs incounter at one time M. <hi>Willet,</hi> and me both together. nay, as if we were nothing in this giants hands, with great arrogancy he ſetteth alſo vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> M. <hi>Thomas Bell,</hi> a man while he was yet a popiſh prieſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them accounted the moſt learned, ſufficient and graue man among their company, and now well knowen by his learned workes not anſwerable, at the leaſt not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, to haue much profited ſince. but what is it, that our wiſe aduerſary obiecteth, that he ſhould cry out ſo loud againſt Maſter <hi>Bell?</hi> what is the <hi>Gordian knot,</hi> that he ſuppoſeth <hi>to be inſoluble?</hi> forſooth, becauſe he ſaith, <hi>that the biſhops of Rome, vntill the daies of Saint Auguſtine, and long after, were very godly men, and taught the ſame doctrine, that Saint Peter had done before them: and yet affirmeth alſo,
<pb facs="tcp:18442:9"/> that pope Syricius was ſeduced by Sathan, publiſhed wicked doctrine &amp; taught the flat doctrine of the divel; &amp; that pope Sozimus brought in ſuperſtition, and falſified the decrees of the Nicene councell. ſo to mainteine the vſurped primacie of the Church of Rome.</hi> as if M. <hi>Belles</hi> propoſitions might not well ſtand together. for he ſaith not, that <hi>all the biſhops of Rome were good and godly men, and taught true doctrine vntill S. Auguſtines time;</hi> but ſpeaketh indefinitly of the biſhops of Rome without adding, <hi>all;</hi> which maner of ſpeech <hi>in materia contingenti,</hi> is not to be taken abſolutely and vniuerſally, but for the moſt part. and ſo no doubt ſaint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking of the biſhops of Rome vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, knowing that <hi>Marcelline</hi> ſacrificed to idoles, and that <hi>Liberius</hi> was an Arrian. and we may ſay alſo, that the apoſtles of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were good men, although <hi>Judas</hi> was a traitor, and lanterne bearer to the Iewes, as ſome popiſh writers ſay, that betraied <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and much of the nature and condition of this <hi>detectour</hi> of falſifications, and detractor from honeſt men, and a very lanterner of Antichriſt, and a traitour to his countrey. let him therefore beware he be not taken paſſing through backe dores, like the idolatrous prieſts of <hi>Bel,</hi> and ſo for his gordian knot, be taken tied in a <hi>Tyburne</hi> knot.</p>
            <p>10 I need not ſay much of our adverſaries forme of writing, or frame of ſentences. for it appeereth euery where, that he did not know the difference of <hi>pneuma,</hi> and <hi>periodus;</hi> nor could diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>colons</hi> and <hi>periodes, commaes</hi> and <hi>colons.</hi> his whole diſcouſe is liker to nothing that I can imagine, then to the way betweene <hi>Chard</hi> and <hi>Honiton</hi> in the weſt countrey, that is, rude and rugged, vp hill and downe hill, and very vnequall. but to let that paſſe, yet may I not paſſe in ſilence, that <note n="a" place="margin">Praefat. fol. 1.</note> ſpeaking <hi>of the great commanders and princely pilots, that ſit at the ſterne of the common wealth,</hi> he ſeemeth to communicate her Maieſties
<pb facs="tcp:18442:10"/> ſouereigne authority to inferior perſons, and doth not once vouchſafe to acknowledge her princely power, or to name her among the governors of this ſtate. and yet ſuch diſloiall traitors, that acknowledge the popes ſupreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and deny her Maieſties power, as being excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate by the popes <hi>ſcuruineſſe,</hi> (our fellow percaſe would ſay <hi>holineſſe</hi>) are not ſought out, nor brought to ſuch a triall, as their offences deſerue.</p>
            <p>By this therefore it may appeare, that, as our aduerſary hath no ability to diſproue any point of religion, which we hold, ſo he hath vtterly ſhamed his conſorts, and the crew of papiſts, that hitherto haue made great brags of this their champion, &amp; of his inuincible arguments, all hard &amp; knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, like the haft of a dougeon dagger. he hath alſo vtterly ſhamed himſelf in medling with theſe matters, being a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not read, nor any way fit to diſcourſe, or handle matter of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſy: the which, that it may further appere, I purpoſe, god willing, not only to iuſtify my former chalenge, which this poore menowe would nibble at, but alſo to diſcharge my ſelfe honeſtly of all thoſe vntruthes and falſifications, which the detractor maliciouſly goeth about to charge vpon me.

I hope alſo, that ſome odde prieſt or other, out of his grammer dictates will admoniſh him, to looke better to his grammer rules, and tell him, that he hath falſified a verſe out of <hi>Horace,</hi> and made a groſſe fault in it. <note place="margin">This is the onely verſe in the booke.</note> for where <hi>Horace</hi> ſaith, <hi>quid dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num tanto feret hic pro miſſor hiatu:</hi> our wiſe <note n="b" place="margin">

            <pb facs="tcp:18442:11"/>
            <p>Both this challenge, and the anſwere to the detractors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, preſuming vpon thy indifferency I recommend to thy reading. much I will not requeſt at thy hands, and ſmall fauours are eaſily granted. Examine, I pray thee, both my anſwere, and my aduerſaries obiections, and yeeld to neither ſide more then is prooued: compare his great brags, with his poore talent of writing, and his ſcornefull termes with his ſlender matters, and thou ſhalt eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that ſhort anſweres may ſerue ſuch ſimple argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. it may be, that thou and I differ in opinion. yet neuer refuſe to yeeld to trueth; nor reſolue to defend diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loialty or errour.</p>
            <p>I haue, as thou maieſt ſee, dealt plainly, and profeſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, that I will not mainteine any error, whereof I can be conuinced. if the aduerſarie would take the ſame courſe, there might be an end of this contention. <hi>Rob. Parſons</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne this quarrell, albeit he hath firſt giuen it ouer. the ground of his pleading ſtanding principally vpon the title of <hi>ancient and catholike religion,</hi> and the innocency of maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing prieſts, and friers, and their conſorts, I gaue him a ſhort iſſue in my former chalenge, and offered to proue, that popiſh religion eſtabliſhed in the conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> and now receiued by the church of Rome, is neither ancient, catholicke, nor true. if they cannot proue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be catholicks, why doe they entitle themſelues ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes? if their relsgion be new, why doe they bragge of antiquity? if they be haeretickes, why are they not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to take to themſelues the praerogatiues of the true church? if the Iebuſites and rheir conſorts be combined with forrein enimies, what reaſon haue they to challenge the fauour due to ſubiects?</p>
            <p>Vpon occaſion of an ecſtaticall fellowes importunity, I doe renew the ſame challenge againe, and by all meanes prouoke <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> to anſwere. and becauſe percaſe
<pb facs="tcp:18442:12"/> he is buſie comploting of matters againſt his country at Rome, I addreſſe it alſo to Frier Garnet and the archprieſt Blackewell, that are neerer at hand, and not vnaquainted with the worthy volume of exceptions lately publiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me. If <hi>Parſons</hi> haue not laiſure, let one of them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. it is a ſhame to begin a quarrell, and to giue it ouer firſt. for one bout they haue no reaſon to refuſe me. if they pretend want of books and laiſure, they know <hi>Doway</hi> is not farre off. They haue begon to crie out of falſifications and untruthes, let them therefore make triall, how they can anſwere for themſelues. <hi>Parſons</hi> was woont to be ready to plead for others. now therefore he hath no reaſon but to plead for himſelfe. In time paſt he and that falſe traitor <hi>Allen</hi> filled mens eares with their clamours, <hi>contra perſequu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores Anglos.</hi> let them therefore defend their conſorts, that are <hi>preditores Angliae,</hi> &amp; enimies to their country. no man hath greater cauſe to defend traitors, then traitors. If they refuſe to anſwere for themſelues, or to ſatisfie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I hope for modeſty ſake hereafter, they will neither arrogate to themſelues the title of the church, nor the ſhelter of catholicke religion, neither can they with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie vant of antiquity, or accuſe true men of hereſie, whereof themſelues are moſt guilty. finally if ſhame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine not their tongues, yet feare of punniſhment may keepe them in temper, being declared to be profeſſed eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to their prince and country, &amp; a packe of rinegned engliſh co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiring with the enimies of this ſtate, &amp; combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together for the ouerthrow of religion &amp; the realme.</p>
            <p>If my aduerſary and his conſorts ſhall no way be able, though otherwiſe willing inough, to cleare themſelues of moſt malitious libelling, lying, and forging, I truſt they wil hereafter ſpare me, a plaine fellow, and one that no way ſtandeth in need of ſuch poore ſhifts for the iuſtification of my cauſe. And I doubt not, but with ſhame inough
<pb facs="tcp:18442:12"/> they will for euer hereafter ceaſe to make any challenge concerning lies and falſifications, hauing ſo euill ſucceſſe in this firſt incounter.</p>
            <p>If I haue cleared this ſtate from all imputation of iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in the proceeding againſt Ieſuites, ſeminary prieſts, popiſh rebels and their adherents; neither haue the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates reaſon to ſuffer <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> his libels to flie abroad to the ſlander of the ſtate, nor any good ſubiect to allow of his calumniations, and moſt wicked libels.</p>
            <p>If it doe clearely appeare, that <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> and his trecherous conſorts are linked and combined with foraine enemies, and by no meanes will ſubmit themſelues to her Maieſties lawes and authoritie, thoſe that haue the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and execution of her lawes, committed vnto them, I doubt not, will haue a watchfull eie ouer the proceedings of ſuch ſlippery companions, and with great conſtancie and reſolution mainteine hir Maieſties authority, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute her lawes againſt ſuch as wilfully impugne it. the late edict publiſhed againſt this vermine, doth ſhew that the ſtate is not onely well acquainted with their leud prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, but alſo reſolute to puniſh ſuch wicked practiſers, and plotters, as hitherto haue abuſed her Maieſties great clemency toward them.</p>
            <p>If it appere that the Iebuſites and prieſts teach haereſie, and lies, it behooveth all true chriſtians to auoid them. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his ſecond epiſtle doth giue vs warning not to haue any familiaritie with them, or ſo much as once <hi>to bidde them God ſpeed.</hi> the church <note n="c" place="margin">Apocal. 2.</note> of <hi>Thyatira</hi> is reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for permitting a wicked falſe prophet <hi>to teach and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Gods people.</hi> and our ſauiour <note n="d" place="margin">Matth. 7.</note> Chriſt giueth vs war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of falſe prophets, <hi>that come vnto vs in ſheepes clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and inwardly are rauening woolues.</hi> theſe falſe maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts deuoure many widdowes houſes, and abuſe the
<pb facs="tcp:18442:13"/> ſimplicity of many yoong youthes to their vtter ruine and deſtruction. and yet that is not the woorſt. for they do not onely ouerthrow their worldly ſtates, but alſo deſtroy their ſoules, and lead them headlong into hell.</p>
            <p>If the popes agents vnder pretence of religion haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled their folowers in diuers practiſes of faction and treaſon, I hope all Engliſh, albeit otherwiſe fauorers of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, wil better looke, how they engage themſelues in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. they come from forreine enemies, and depend vpon them; and though they talke of religion, yet their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is wholy for the pope and Spaniard, and their courſe is irreligious and factious.</p>
            <p>If popiſh religion founded in the conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> and taught by late popes and their proctors be catholike, and ancient, then will it be an eaſie matter to ſhew it, and to anſwer our obiections, where we prooue the contrary. if our aduerſaries flie triall, and will not ioine with vs, and directly anſwere; then haue all papiſts and others, reaſon to flie from ſuch falſe teachers, and heretikes, and to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all their wicked haereſies. there is no agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Chriſt and Belial,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note> betwixt trueth and error, light and darknes. if they can ſhew themſelues, that they are no ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, they will cleere themſelues: if not, why do they ſeeke to erect altars of <hi>Baal</hi> in euery corner? and why doe not all Chriſtians auoid to communicate with the prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> in their idolatrous maſſe? <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.</note> 
               <hi>there is no agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the temple of God and idoles,</hi> neither <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> 
               <hi>can any drinke the Lords cuppe, that doth participate at the table of diuels,</hi> or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueliſh maſſe. but what ſhould I talke of the Lords cup, when theſe idolatrous prieſts take the Lords cup from all that follow them?</p>
            <p>If the aduerſaries be cleare of lying and falſification; then will they anſwer plainly and directly, as I haue anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:18442:13"/> them. if their lies and forgeries be made notorious to the world, he is not very wiſe, that will truſt ſuch lying and forging companions.</p>
            <p>But what ſhould I need to declare that briefely, which at large is prooued in the diſcourſe following? reade onely diligently, and examine carefully, and iudge indifferently. and ſo leauing thee to thy meditations, and referring thee to the touch of both our aduerſaries accuſations, and our anſwers, I beſeech God to giue thee true vnderſtanding of his ſauing trueth. and that hee will giue thee grace, if thou knoweſt the trueth, to perſeuere conſtant vnto the end: if thou carieſt a preiudicate affection towards pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then to ſee into the deformities, impoſtures and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of popiſh religion: and that in the end it will pleaſe him, to diſcouer all fraudes, impoſtures, conſpiracies, trecheries and vilanies of the popiſh faction, and to let thee ſee the damnation of the great whore, and the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Babylon.

               <p>Finally they are moſt of them vncapable of miniſteriall function, and can neither teach, nor adminiſter the ſacraments duly, and if they were able, yet doe they not teach Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but rather by their maſſes and confeſſions draw them to ſuperſtition and diſloialty.</p>
               <p>That the Romiſh church hath no true biſhops, it is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued both by the ſame and other reaſons, firſt no heretikes haue power to ordeine others. but the pope is an heretike, <hi>ergo,</hi> the

                  <hi>epiſcopatus is opus.</hi> but the pope doth not the office of a biſhop, either in teaching or adminiſtring the ſacraments. further, biſhops, as Cyprian diuerſly declareth, are the ſucceſſours of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. but the Pope ſuccéedeth <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the gouernment of Rome, rather than <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> in gouerning the church. and other Romiſh biſhops, they rather kill Chriſtes ſhéepe, and maſſacre his lambs, than feed them. finally, Romiſh bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, albeit they are after a ſort ſent to teach and adminiſter ſacraments, yet moſt of them are vncapable of that charge, and all leaue the office of teaching, to a packe of loud mouthed monks and babling friers, thinking that too baſe an office for their great and high eſtate.</p>
               <p>But had Romiſh prieſts and biſhops any miſſion or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yet is the ſame very defectiue, and diuers from the graue forme practiſed in the ancient church. for neither is ſuch regard had of the capacity and ability of the perſons choſen to this function, but that often times boies and infamous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are called to this charge; neither are the ſolemnities pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the canons obſerued, nor doe either the prieſts or bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops teach true doctrine, and ſincerely adminiſter the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor doe they finally attend that office, and execute that worke, whereto they are called. If therfore the Romiſh prieſts and biſhops haue no due ordination or calling; then are not the papiſts the true church. if their ordination be imperfect and faultie, then ſuch is the popiſh church, as their popiſh or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of miniſters is, that is faulty, defectiue, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>

Let vs ſée therefore, whether they ſpeake truly, or no. and albeit we ſhould greatly wrong the ſtate, if we ſhould diſpute this point, as a matter doubtfull; yet let vs, I ſay briefely touch it for ſatiſfaction of the ignorant, eſpecially ſuch as are ſtrangers, and vnacquainted with the triall of ſuch prieſts, friers and other the popes agents, as haue bene executed in England, as offending in caſes of treaſon.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, that no one prieſt, Ieſuit, or other papiſt in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland hath beene executed for treaſon, but he hath bene found guilty of practiſing againſt her <hi>Maieſtie</hi> and the ſtate, or at the leaſt aiding, and aſſiſting, and intertaining of ſuch practiſers, and ſeditious perſons: and that diuers of them haue either ſtood armed againſt the ſtate in open rebellion, or elſe ioined with the rebells, and aſſiſted them to their vttermoſt power, and meanes. and this appeareth <hi>firſt</hi> by faculties granted to <hi>Thomas Harding</hi> about the yeere 1567. for the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people to the pope, and for the diſturning of them from their obedience to the Prince. for whatſoeuer the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was, the end was ſedition and rebellion, he being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for nothing elſe, but to be a forerunner of that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy friers <hi>Impius Quintus</hi> his excommunication againſt the <hi>Queene. ſecondly</hi> it is proued by the rebellion in the north <hi>anno</hi> 1569. which was ſtirred vp by one <hi>Nicholas Morton,</hi> and other ſeditious prieſts. <hi>thirdly</hi> by the rebellion and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>duke of Norfolke</hi> ſtirred vp by the pope as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the report of <hi>Hierome Catena,</hi> in the life of <hi>Pius Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. fourthly</hi> by the erection of two ſeminaries of treaſon, the one erected at <hi>Doway anno</hi> 1569. and another at <hi>Rome anno</hi> 1579. or thereabout which were receptacles of ſuch ſcattered and loſt prieſts, as had bene in rebellion, and open ſchooles to teach treaſon to malcontent papiſts. <hi>fiftly</hi> by the rebellion of the earle of <hi>Deſmond</hi> in Ireland raiſed by the ſolicitation of

The 9. argument may be drawne from the practiſe of <hi>Charles Paget</hi> with the earle of <hi>Northumberland, anno domini</hi> 1583. that by all meanes ſolicited him to reuolt, and to ioine with the French againſt the State.

The 11. is grounded vpon the inſurrection of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and the reſt of that raſcall rout ſtirred vp by <hi>Monford</hi> a prieſt yet lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in England, and diuers other ſeditious agents of the pope. The laſt is that dangerous attempt of the late earle of

                  <hi>Eſſexe,</hi> which maketh my heart to bléed in reſpect of ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate cauſes, as oft as I remember it, and moueth many to woonder, that he ſhould be made an inſtrument by theſe fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands of ſedition, to ſet vp that religion, which I thinke he neuer loued. and my arguments are prooued good, for that no one of thoſe, that haue béene executed for the popes cauſe, can be named, but either he was an agent in ſome of theſe practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or allowed them, or were priuy vnto them. nay, I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue, that if the queſtion were aſked of any <hi>Ieſuit,</hi> or <hi>Ieſuited</hi> prieſt, or any of their adherents, he would not diſallow the popes act, or the acts of his agents in ſtirring vp rebellion in England, and Ireland, eſpecially for matter of religion. what others would doe I know not. but hitherto we finde, that they ſpeake honorably of <hi>Card.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18442:96"/> or ſweare concerning practiſes of rebellion; yet vnleſſe they will forſweare the pope, they muſt néeds be rebels, and ſtirre vp rebellion, as oft as he liſteth. for the <note n="h" place="margin">

               <p>Thoſe therefore, that died in the popes quarrell, are traitors, and not martyrs. and that will be the caſe alſo of all their conſorts, if they paſſe that way, which I would haue not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all Ieſuits and maſſeprieſts to conſider, but alſo all thoſe, that like their humors, and opinions. neither is it materiall, that grace hath bene offered to ſome, that haue bene executed for treaſon, if they would haue renounced the pope, &amp; his tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous doctrine and faction. for that ſheweth not, that the parties, to whom this grace was offered, were no traitors,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:18442:109"/> but rather her Maieſties great clemency, that was willing to pardon all, of whom any hope might be conceiued, that they would become good ſubiects. ſo likewiſe if a man ſhould offer pardon to an Aſſaſſin, it doth not proue that ſuch as murder men vpon a leud conceit of wrong religion died as martyrs.</p>
               <p>If then the papiſts be not the true church; I truſt all true Chriſtians will avoid them. if their doctrine be neither anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, nor catholicke, I hope true catholicks will no longer ſuffer themſelues to be abuſed by them. if they be hereticks; they will, I truſt, for very ſhame forbeare to impute hereſies to true Chriſtians. if maſſeprieſts be idolaters; I hope religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſtians will take order with them, as godly kings did with <hi>Baals</hi> prieſts. finally if maſſeprieſts and the popes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents haue ſo farre engaged themſelues in treaſon; I hope all true ſubiects will learne to deteſt popery, not onely in regard, that it is a falſe religion, but alſo, becauſe it is a packe of leud opinions borne out with all fraud, vileny and treaſon. which becauſe it floweth from the forge of Antichriſtes authority and inuention; let vs beſéech God, to reueale dayly more and more the man of ſinne, that ſuch as now are abuſed by him, may forſake him, and ſerue God in ſpirit and trueth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his holy word.

But were it his, and did he write, <hi>that Ecdicia, &amp; her husband promiſing continencie, were to perſeuere in that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:</hi> yet that proueth not, that if they were not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their vow, that therefore they might not come togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For they liued in one houſe togither, &amp; tooke no ſolemne vow. <hi>Ei obſequi</hi> ſayth the author of that Epiſtle, <hi>in dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtica conuerſatione debuiſti.</hi> Beſide that, they had houſe and goods, and the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was reprehended, for that ſhe gaue them away: which is contrary to the courſe of Monkery in our times. Finally albeit this were the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of one man, is it not ridiculous, to thinke, that all the Church in externall matters was led, and gouerned by one mans opinion?</p>
                  <p>To that place which I alledged out of the 19. of <hi>Math.</hi> hee anſwereth, <hi>that the band of matrimony doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue ſtil

Which becauſe it proceedeth from his ignoraunce, I will direct him to his maſters, that will teach him, <hi>that the ſame honour is due to the Image, that is due to the originall, and that therefore, the Image of Chriſt is to bee worſhipped, as wee worſhip Chriſt, and the Image of our Ladie with Hyperdulia, and the Images of Saintes with the worſhip of Doulia:</hi> as appeareth by the teſtimonie of <hi>Alexander Hales,</hi> 3. <hi>p. quaeſt.</hi> 3. <hi>art. vlt.

                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay alſo, that as the Gentiles did worſhip their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſo likewiſe the Papiſts doe worſhip the Images of the Crucifixe, the Croſſe, the Images alſo of our Ladie, and the Saints. For firſt as the Gentiles called on their Idols, ſo the Papiſtes ſay to the Croſſe, <hi>O Crux aue
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18442:117"/> ſpes vnica, auge piis iuſtitiam:</hi> and to the picture called <hi>Veronica, ſalue ſancta facies.

Thirdly,</hi> as the Gentiles did burne incenſe to their Images, ſo doe the Papiſts before theirs. Finally, as the Gentiles did bowe downe to their Images and kiſſe them, and pray before them, ſo doe the Papiſts fall downe before ſtockes and ſtones, kiſſe their Images, and pray before them, as both the practiſe of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, and the doctrine of the Schoolemen doth ſhew. The Images of our Ladie of <hi>Loreto,</hi> of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> and in England the Image of our Ladie of Walſingham, and diuerſe Saints ſhrines, doe ſhewe my wordes to bee moſt true. But ſayth <hi>Owlyglaſſe, the Councell of Trent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth, that due honour is to be giuen to Images, but not ſo, as that wee are to put truſt in them, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles did ſometimes.</hi> But what if the Papiſts regarde not the decree of this abſurd conuenticle?

But this toucheth vs nothing. for we know, that the Romiſh ſynagogue is not the true Church, and that the ancient Church neuer approued either the <hi>Romiſh</hi> doctrine, or the <hi>Romiſh</hi> order concerning faſting.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> was neither able to prooue the Romiſh orders of Lenten faſtes, or of embre daies, nor brought any one author to iuſtifie the faſts vpon vigils of Saints, what an impudent fellow was he to affirme, <note place="margin">Page, 26.</note> 
                     <hi>that in ancient times the Church of Chriſt enioyned Chriſtians to faſt Lent, embre daies, and vigils of Saints,</hi> ſhuffling in vigils of Saints into his concluſion, of which he had not brought any proofe in his premiſſes? Secondly, if he would contradict me, why did he not ſpeake of the maner of the Romiſh faſts? Laſtly, what reaſon hath he to charge me, as hauing <hi>dealt without conſcience,</hi> where I denied their manner of faſtes to be Catholike and chriſtian; when he ſheweth neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, witte, learning, nor modeſtie in holding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie?</p>
                  <p>That I haue deliuered my opinion with good conſcience, and that he with a cauterized conſcience pinned to the Popes ſléeue hath contradicted my aſſertion, it may alſo further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the forme of Romiſh faſts. For <hi>firſt,</hi> the Romaniſtes place their faſts in abſtinence from fleſh, and not in abſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from meate, or eating drie meats, or abſtinence from wine, as the Eaſterne Churches did. Secondly they eate large dinners, and refraine not from them, as the author of the 62. ſer. <hi>de tempore,</hi> among S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> workes thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth they ſhould. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they beléeue that by eating fleſh, and redd herring, and ſuch like meate, they are able to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for their ſinnes, and to inherit the kingdome of heauen: which is not only erronious but alſo moſt ridiculous <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> they teach that faſting in Lent was inſtituted by Chriſt,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18442:120"/> and that the other faſts are apoſtolicall traditions. <hi>Finally,</hi> they burne true chriſtians for eating of a péece of fleſh vpon a faſting day. The which doctrine and practiſe is not only contrary to the doctrine of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and the fathers of the Church, but alſo to the practiſe of the ancient apoſtolike Churches, whoſe faſhions we are farre to prefer before the practiſe of the late apoſtatical ſynagogue of Roome. Our Sauiour he teacheth vs, <hi>that we are not defiled by any meate, that entreth into a mans body. Quod intrat in os</hi> ſaith hée, <note place="margin">Matth. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>non coinquinat hominem.</hi> We may alſo thereout gather, that it is not meate, that doth ſatiſfie vs. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth ſignifie, that this difference of meates procéedeth from the ceremoniall law, and therefore ought now to ceaſe. <hi>If ye be dead with Chriſt,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>from the Elements of this world, why doe you yet decree, ſaying, touch not, taſt not, handle not, which all goe into deſtruction in vſe, according to the preceptes and doctrine of man. Thirdly,</hi> the Apoſtle doth alſo propheſie, <hi>that in the latter times ſome ſhall depart from the faith, forbidding to marry, &amp; enioyning abſtinence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meats, which God hath created.</hi> Neither can this be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of auncient heretickes, that thought fleſh vncleane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he ſpeaketh of the latter times and ſaith <hi>in nouiſſimis tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus.</hi> The Papiſtes alſo would not ſo ſeuerely forbid eating of fleſh, vnleſſe they thought it a more holy matter to eate fiſh. <hi>Fourthly, Tertullian</hi> ſheweth that Chriſtians faſted vpon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their owne accord, and not by conſtrainte of lawes. <hi>Indifferenter ex arbitrio, non ex imperio nouae diſciplinae,</hi> ſaith he, <note place="margin">Aduerſ.

Finally the weake and abſurd diſpute of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that is not able to produce any inſtitution of this pretended ſacrament, nor to confirme, either the forme, or the matter, or the doctrine of it, may reſolue a man, that the whole, as it is practiſed by the Romiſh Church, is a new inuention. <note place="margin">Page, 31.</note> All this notwithanding our aduerſary ſaith, <hi>that it is a palpable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth. viz.</hi> to affirme the forme of Popiſh confirmation, to be a new inuention. <hi>For to omit</hi> ſaith he, <hi>how the forme of this Sacrament is as auncient, as the Apoſtles.</hi> But if he had

And what likelyhood is there, that the Apoſtles did practiſe this forme, when we finde no record or memoriall of it in auncient, and authenticall hiſtories? Is it likely that the auncient church would not mention all the formes of their ſacraments?</p>
                  <p>He ſaith alſo, <hi>that we cannot ſhew any later beginning of confirmation.</hi> as if we did not note <hi>the time of the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Armenians,</hi> and conuenticle of <hi>Trent;</hi> before which the ſchoolemen babled their pleaſure, but they had no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine reſolution on which they depended.</p>

                  <p>This done, he proceedeth on, and ſaith: <hi>To omit this, and many notable things els, that it is ſufficient to conuince maſter Sutcliffe of vntruth, that Thomas of Aquine almoſt two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares before the councell of Florence, ſetteth downe the verie ſame forme, affirming it to be the vſuall and common forme practiſed in the church, and Bellarmine, noteth this place of Thomas.</hi> But he ſheweth himſelfe a ſimple fellow, to omit notable things, and to ſay nothing worthy to be noted.

                     </hi> but this is not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſification, as he might haue knowne, if he had knowne any thing. Nay it is not vntruth neither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as <hi>Marcion</hi> ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red women to baptize, and extolled virginitie although he was a falſe lecher, and taught abſtinence from liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſeparated mariage for religion, as is before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the 4. chapter of my challenge, ſo doe Papiſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer women to baptize, and their lecherous prieſts, albeit they extoll virginitie and abiure mariage, yet liue moſt diſſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18442:133"/> Their Monkes abſtaine from fleſh, and they vſe to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate mariages for religion, and all this <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to paſſe ouer in ſilence, as if it had been deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him vnder the ſeale of confeſſion, although the ſame was plainly and publikely obiected in my former challenge, and was eaſie to be found, being ſet downe in the ſame place, where he ſuppoſeth, that I haue committed this foreſaide falſification.</p>
                  <p>But ſaith he, <hi>he doth falſifie Epiphanius, wreſting him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his meaning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> as if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> were to bee charged with falſification as oft, as he doth wreſt places contrarie to the meaning of the authors. He ſaith alſo, <hi>that I conceale his words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> but he muſt be a miraculous fellow, that will make him a falſifier, that doth not ſo much as alleadge any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Such a ſimple fellow is <hi>Owlyglaſſe,</hi> with whom I doe contend, that the poore fellow cannot tell what he would ſay. I will therefore helpe to tell his tale, and ſhew that he is the falſifier, and not I.</p>
                  <p>In my challenge I doe charge the Papiſts, as ſauouring of diuers points of hereſie maintained by <hi>Marcion,</hi> and his followers. Among other things I ſay, <hi>that Marcion taught that by Chriſts deſcending into hell diuers mens ſoules were thence deliuered, and that he ſeparated mariages for religion.</hi> And afterwards I adde, <hi>that the Papiſts ſauour ſtrongly of theſe hereſies,</hi> and namely, <hi>in that they ſeparate mariages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted after vowes, &amp; by vowes breake mariages before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,</hi> and alſo <hi>in that they defend that diuers mens ſoules were deliuered out of limbus patrum,</hi> which is a place in hel, as they confeſſe. All this <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> iumbleth togither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing two or thrée ſentences, and ſetting downe what hée pleaſeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is therefore without colour taken in the act of falſification. As for me, he cannot charge with any ſuch tricke; nor iuſtly ſay, that I either ſet downe <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his words falſely, or ſpeake vntruely. But ſaith he, <hi>Marcion held, that Iewes and Infidels were deliuered out of hell, which wee beleeue not, and therefore wee are not to bee charged with Marcioniſme.</hi> neither doe I charge them otherwiſe, <hi>then ſauouring of that hereſie.</hi> And this is moſt true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18442:133"/> they agrée not in particulars; yet both <hi>Marcioniſtes</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> beléeue, that ſoules may be deliuered out of hell. Nay they are not aſhamed to teach, that by the prayers of <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, Traians</hi> ſoule and the ſoule of an idolater called <hi>Falconilla</hi> were deliuered out of hell, which <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> confeſſeth to be <hi>Marcions</hi> opinion. And if ſoules may be deliuered out of hell (which is the place of the damned, as appeareth by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers teſtimonies of ſcriptures) why may not wicked mens ſoules be deliuered out of hell?</p>
                  <p>Finally he quoteth the fourth councell of <hi>Toledo c.</hi> 1. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> his Epiſtle <hi>ad Trallianos. Cyrilles Catech.</hi> 4. <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius haereſ.</hi> 46. <hi>Hierome</hi> vpon the 4. to the Epheſ. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries morals lib.</hi> 13. <hi>c.</hi> 20. But the ſilly fellow had dronke too much, when he calculated his diſtempered exceptions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for els I beléeue, that he would haue remembred, that we doe not diſpute here, what the fathers hold concerning <hi>limbus patrum,</hi> but whether <hi>Epiphanius</hi> were truely alleadged, or not. He tolde vs in the beginning, that he would make his readers ſée and féele falſifications, and that by opening the bookes, as it were, with a wet finger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet here he is not able to ſhew any ſuch matter with all the skill he hath. Nay if falſification be committed, when fathers are falſely allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, then is this <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> a notorious falſificator. For not one of them once ſpeaketh or mentioneth <hi>limbus patrum.</hi> Nor is <hi>Bellar.</hi> albeit farther traueiled in the fathers then <hi>Owlygl.</hi> able to finde <hi>limbus patrum</hi> in the fathers writings, or that they diſtinguiſh hell into parts, or prouinces, or ſpeake of <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, as the Papiſts doe. And that may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> diſpute <hi>de anima Chriſti cap.</hi> 14. from whence our aduerſarie borrowed all his broken quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and allegations touching this point; if any man liſt to read the place.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O prooue that the <hi>Caians</hi> were reputed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes for the worſhipping of Angels and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bnto them, I alleadge the words of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius Haereſ.</hi> 38. <hi>vnuſquiſque eorum vniuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuiuſque angeli nomen inuocat.</hi> Here my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary ſaith, <hi>that I haue chopt of ſome wordes in the midſt of the ſentence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Beſides that, the wordes which I omitted, doe rather make againſt the Papiſtes, then for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as the <hi>Caians</hi> do call ſomtime on true Angels, ſometime on thoſe which they ſuppoſe to be Angels; ſo do Papiſts in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers pray to <hi>Vriell,</hi> and other ſuppoſed Angels. They alſo pray to the Angell, which they ſuppoſe to be their kéeper, as groſly as the <hi>Caians,</hi> ſaying, <hi>obſecro te Angelice ſpiritus, cui ego indignus peccator ad prouidendum commiſſus ſum,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">In hortulo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimae pariſ. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſ. anno. 1565.</note>

But ſaith <hi>Owlyglaſſe,</hi> hée <hi>hath perfidiouſly peruerted the whole ſence of that father.</hi> But if he and his conſortes did vſe no more perfidious dealing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their prince and contry, then I haue doone in this caſe they would not ſo perfidiouſly combine themſelues with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine enemies. As for this charge of perfidiouſneſſe, it falleth not vpon me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I doe alleadge <hi>Epiphanius</hi> to proue only, <hi>that the Caians did worſhip and inuocat Angels.</hi> And this I haue
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18442:134"/> proued out of his words moſt iuſtly &amp; truely. But had I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken his meaning, yet is not that falſification, but an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: where as commonly the detector both falſifieth and erreth.</p>
                  <p>Being therefore not able to ſay much concerning the point in queſtion, <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> aſketh me, <hi>with conſcience I could charge his conſorts the Papiſtes with the abominable hereſie of the Caians.</hi> But this is another accuſation farre from the purpoſe. Beſide that, I ſhewed him the point of the charge, &amp; told him as plaine as I could, <hi>that both Papiſts and Caians worſhip Angels.</hi> But ſaith he, <hi>do we teach that ech An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell hath doone ſome horrible ſinne vpon earth? or do we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocat falſe Angels, or any Angell at all in that ſorte, that the Caians did?</hi> And in the ende, he cryeth out, <hi>what is lying, what is falſification, if this be not?</hi> But his reader hath reaſon to crie out rather, what is foolery, what is dizardry, if this bee not? For I doe not charge the Papiſtes in all points to agrée with the <hi>Caians.</hi> Neither can the Papiſtes diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of the note of hereſie, if in any ſort they agrée with the <hi>Caians.</hi> but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> did I declare plainly, &amp; <hi>Owliglaſſe</hi> cannot deny, that both <hi>Caians,</hi> and Papiſtes worſhip and call vpon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Againe it apeareth, that the <hi>Caians</hi> were condemned not for calling vpon falſe Angels only, as <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, but vpon true Angels. <hi>Vniuſcuiuſque Angeli nomen inuocat, tum eorum qui ſunt Angeli,</hi> ſaith <hi>Epiphanius, tum eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum qui ficte dicuntur Angeli.</hi> It appeareth therefore, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> accompted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heretickes that worſhipped true angels, and not only falſe angels as <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> falſely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth. But if the Papiſtes could auoyd that charge; yet if they worſhip newe orders of angels, and their angelicall kéepers, it ſhould ſéeme, they cannot auoyde the charge of calling vpon falſe Angels. Finally as the <hi>Caians</hi> called vpon angels hauing committed great ſinnes, ſo the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſodomitciall Prieſts confeſſe their great ſins to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and deſire their helpe. In the old ordinall of Rome printed at Rome <hi>anno.</hi> 159. and dedicated to <hi>Sixtus quintus,</hi> euery preiſt in this common forme of confeſſion beginning <hi>confiteor deo omnipotenti,</hi> ſaith, <hi>peccaui in Sodomia.

                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:18442:135"/> therefore may do well to trie his skill, if he can cleare his conſorts of this blot alſo. But he muſt beware, that he blurre them not as well with ſodomy, as he hath blotted them with the worſhip of angels, being not able to touch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the reſt of my arguments, which are diuers. So braue a patron is <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> of the Popiſh cauſe.</p>

                  <p>Now what ſaith the falſificator, and grand excoriatour of mens writings to all this? <hi>Firſt,</hi> he confeſſeth, <hi>that it is moſt true, that his conſorts permit women to baptize.</hi> But our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſent his diſciples to baptize, and not any wemen. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he giue to wemen that power. Further we may not thinke, that wemen may with better right Baptize, then preach. Yet the Apoſtle, permitteth not a woman to ſpeake in the congregation, <note place="margin">Haereſ. 49.</note> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> alleadgeth that place of the Apoſtle againſt the <hi>Pepuzians.</hi> Why then ſhould not <hi>Pepuzians</hi> and Papiſts in this caſe be like? <hi>Secondly,</hi> he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about to ſhew, that the <hi>Pepuzians,</hi> and Papiſts are vnlike, and namely <hi>for that the Papiſtes doe permit wemen to baptize only in time of neceſſitie. And for that the Pepuzians did giue prieſthood to wemen.</hi> In which two points he would inferre, that there is a mayne difference betwixt Papiſts &amp; <hi>Pepuzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> But his concluſion is ſo ſimple, that it can abide noe touch. For he is an hereticke, that holdeth any pointe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for hereſie, &amp; not thoſe only which do iumpe with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes in all points, and circumſtances. If then the Papiſts ſhould differ in two, or thrée points from <hi>Pepuzians;</hi> yet muſt they néedes ſauour of that hereſie, in permitting wemen to baptize, and deriuing the ſucceſſion of Popes from Pope <hi>Ioa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> and other particulers before reherſed. Finally he would willingly proue the vnlawfulnes of weme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s baptiſme by the practiſe of our Church. For ſaith he, <hi>the ſame doctrine is found in the communion booke in the treatiſe of priuat baptiſme: where albeit wemen are nor mentioned, yet for that weme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are then preſent only, they are expreſſed.</hi> He affirmeth alſo, <hi>that M. Hooker doth defend womens baptiſme, &amp; that I muſt defend it, vnleſſe I will change my opinion.</hi> But while he goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to excuſe his conſorts, he runneth himſelfe into danger, and like a ſhameleſſe fellow bouldly auoucheth diuers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes. For firſt the practiſe of the Church of England is againſt wemens baptiſme, and diuers Popiſh callats haue
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18442:137"/> béene puniſhed for attempting to adminiſter that holy ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the booke <hi>doth expreſſe</hi> no ſuch matter, as <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> pretendeth, but onely would haue children in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie baptized priuatly, which may be done by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, if the parents and friends of the childe be diligent. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> M. <hi>Hooker</hi> neuer was of that opinion, that the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion booke allowed priuat baptiſme, as <hi>Owlygl.</hi> impudently affirmeth. Nay, albeit he will not denie ſuch baptiſme to be of validitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he ſaith, <hi>that ſuch perſons as doe baptize</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, being no miniſters, doe <hi>vnlawfully vſurpe the miniſters office.</hi> But <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> alleadging M. <hi>Hookers</hi> firſt booke <hi>p.</hi> 62. for the fift booke <hi>ſect.</hi> 62. ſeemeth not to haue read the booke, which he quoteth. <hi>Finally</hi> for my ſelfe I anſwere that hee cannot with any deuiſe make it appeare, that in this point, or any other, I do oppugne, or digreſſe from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion booke. <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> therefore may doe well to bring better ſtuffe, if he will conuince me of falſification, and to ceaſe to talke of <hi>tippets and caps,</hi> himſelfe hauing as much learning almoſt in his cap as in his head, and ſo well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a Tiburne tippet for his treacherous Diuinitie.</p>
                  <p>In the meane while let him put on a paire of ſpectacles, and he ſhall ſée, that he was much deceiued, where he ſaith, <hi>I doe guilefully quote S. Auguſtine.</hi> For to this point of we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens baptiſme I quote him not at all.</p>

But leaſt any might thinke, that I wronged the ſée of <hi>Rome,</hi> from whom all theſe abuſes are deriued; I would pray euerie man, that hath skill and ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with indifferencie to reade the Legends of the Romiſh Church, the <hi>Rubtikes</hi> of the maſſe, their rituall and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall bookes, their treatiſes of the Popes authoritie, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous lies of <hi>Caeſar Baronius,</hi> that filthy lying Cardinall, and ſuch like teſtimonials as they prooue their religion by. Now we will onely talke of the definition of a Romiſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike, that euery man may ſée, what a bare fellowe he is, and how little religion and honeſty he hath. I ſay that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> teacheth, <hi>that he is a good Romiſh Catholike, and a true member of the Romiſh church, that profeſſeth the Romiſh faith, and communicateth with the Romaniſtes in their ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and is obedient to the Pope: yea although he haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inward faith, nor charitie, nor other inward vertue.</hi> And thereupon I conclude, that the Papiſts are like to the <hi>Euno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians, that taught, that ſo a man were of their religion, it skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not, what ſinnes he committed.</hi> That <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſo tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, it is apparant by his words in his ſecond chapter <hi>de eccleſia militanti.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18442:142"/> the true definition of a Romane catholike may be affirmed, then may all wicked and damnable heretikes be true <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> catholikes, if they profeſſe the <hi>Romiſh</hi> faith, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with the Romaniſts in ſacraments, and ſubmit themſelues to the Pope. But ſaith <hi>Owlyglaſſe Bellarmine</hi> ſaith not, <hi>that ſuch as want inward verrues, are good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,</hi> but onely, <hi>that they are true members of the Church.</hi> As if the true members of Chriſts church were not good ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes; or as if he were not a good citizen, of whom the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a citizen may truly be affirmed: and as if he could not be a good, and true pope, that is no good man. Of which point our aduerſarie muſt beware, leaſt he touch too rudely the ſores of his holy father, and of a pope make no pope.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith further, that this obiection of <hi>Eunomianiſme</hi> is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be charged vpon <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> (for ſo this papal ſwad doth call Chriſtians) and vpon M. <hi>Willet,</hi> they giuing exceſſiue prerogatiues to faith, and ſuch as teach, that a true faith cannot be loſt. But albeit he take his pleaſure to rayle vpon me; yet ſhould he forbeare to wrong thoſe, that are either at reſt, or at the leaſt neuer wronged him. And in this place hauing his hands ſo full of me, he might well haue ſpared to contend with others, being no match for any. To his charge I anſwere, that <hi>Eunomius</hi> his hereſies touch vs nothing. For neither doe we déeme them good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as <hi>Eunomius</hi> did, that haue no inward faith, nor workes; nor did <hi>Eunomius</hi> talke of the faith of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> as we doe, when we ſay the <hi>iuſt</hi> ſhall liue by faith, but of his owne new deuiſed faith. <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> therefore hath no reaſon, for any thing done by me, to crie out, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is abuſed, and his words falſified; nor to charge vs with <hi>Eunomius</hi> his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. But his conſorts will, and iuſtly may thinke him an idle fellow, if he can no better either cleare himſelfe, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince others, eſpecially taking vpon him to doe both.</p>

                  <p>But ſaith <hi>Owlyglaſſe, if it be Montaniſme, to denie ſecond mariages to be ſo holy a ſacrament, as the firſt, what then be they, that denie firſt and ſecond mariages, to be any ſacrament at all?</hi> But this is a balde kinde of diſputing, to propoſe a mans argument, otherwiſe, then he frameth it.

Of which that is an argument, that the Papiſts accompt not the ſecond mariage ſo holy a ſacrament, as the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he denyeth that Papiſts miſlike ſecond mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Canon <hi>de his</hi> 31. <hi>q.</hi> 1. doth teſtifie againſt him.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith thirdly, that the bleſſing of the firſt mariage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that therefore they bleſſe not ſecond mariages, becauſe they had bleſſed them before. But howe doth the bleſſing of the firſt mariage remaine, when a maid is maried to a widowe? Further, the Canon <hi>de his</hi> 31. <hi>q.</hi> 1. ſheweth, <hi>that ſecond mariages were puniſhed with penance,</hi> and prieſts forbidden to be preſent at the feaſt, as if ſuch mariages were impure, and vnlawfull.</p>
                  <p>He would fourthly prooue, that ſecond mariages are not to be bleſſed by the teſtimonie of S. <hi>Auguſtine ſerm.</hi> 243. <hi>de tempore,</hi> and the 7. Canon of the councell of <hi>Neocaeſarea.</hi> But after his cogging manner he belyeth S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who ſpeaketh nothing of the bleſſing of the ſecond mariages, nor of the bleſſing of the prieſt, but rather of Gods bleſſing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to ſuch, as kéepe firſt concubines, and then marie. The councell of <hi>Neocaeſarea</hi> hath nothing of the bleſſing of ſecond mariages, but enioyneth prieſts to abſtaine from ſuch mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18442:143"/> feaſts, and condemneth them as vnlawfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that, I doubt, <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> will hardly, without ſome ſlie diſtinction, be able to defend this councels act.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith finally, <hi>that Montaniſts were not counted heretiks for not bleſſing the ſecond mariages, nor for reputing ſecond mariages not ſo holy a ſacrament as the firſt, as I would make my reader beleeue, but for condemning them vtterly as wicked and vnlawfull.</hi> He beareth his reader alſo in hand, <hi>that I doe maliciouſly ſuppreſſe the authours words, to the ende, not to haue my iugling eſpied.</hi> But notwithſtanding his iugling, and lying, he cannot ſo eſcape the note of <hi>Montaniſme.</hi> For firſt I doe not argue the Papiſts to be <hi>Montaniſts</hi> for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſurmiſed by <hi>Owlyglaſſe,</hi> but for their diſlike of ſecond mariages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this diſlike I prooue by thoſe, which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth, and by other arguments. Secondly, if ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne ſecond mariages, as ſinfull, be <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> then muſt they either blot out the Canon, <hi>de his</hi> 31. <hi>q.</hi> 1. or confeſſe themſelues <hi>Montaniſts.</hi> The gloſſe is driuen to poore ſhiftes to ſalue the hurt of this Canon; and yet cannot ridde his hands with any honeſty of the matter. Thirdly, it is a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous point, to charge me with ſuppreſſing an authours wordes, when I doe not ſo much, as intend to name an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, nor ayme at any mans words. <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> therefore might doe himſelfe more credite to leaue his lewd termes of <hi>iugling,</hi> and <hi>ſlandring,</hi> and ſuch like, and beſtow them on the maſſeprieſts his conſorts, whoſe whole practiſe is nothing els almoſt, but cogging, lying, and iugling, and moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dealing.</p>
                  <p>And thus all that ſmoake, which our aduerſarie firſt rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his fierie and turbulent exclamations, is vaniſhed away, and all doubt either of ſuppoſed vntruthes, or falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations cleared in the iudgement of all indifferent readers, and by the confeſſion of the aduerſarie alſo, vnleſſe he be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to maintaine the quarell which he hath begun, and to put away my anſwere to his former exceptions.

And if his former accuſations concerning vntruths and falſifications, be nothing; it is very probable, that theſe idle fancies, which he calleth obſeruations are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if not leſſe then nothing, and that they are like to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles built in the ayre, and fooliſh conceits of a man of diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered humours. The which albeit the reader may well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by himſelfe, and by my former anſwere, wherein all his odious ſlanders are well rebated; yet leaſt <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> ſhould runne madde by conceit of his owne proweſſe, I am determined for euery indifferent mans further ſatiſfaction, to procéede forward, and to yéeld an anſwere to his vaine, weake, and abſurd obſeruations and concluſions.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Pag. 82. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruat.</note> Firſt he obſerueth, <hi>that a filthy fardle of fowle lies, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions is contained in my whole booke, when one Chapter of my Challenge hath affoorded ſo many.</hi> But this filthy rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18442:144"/> compagnion compounded of a fardle of fooleries and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, and ſauouring like the bottome of an olde broken lampe, of the Popes greaſie ſuperſtitions, hath no reaſon to charge me with lies or corruptions, vnleſſe he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince me, and iuſtifie his exceptions concerning matters ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed falſe and forged. Whether he be able to conuince me or no, I appeale to the indifferent examination of both our diſcourſes. I doe therefore retort this argument vpon <hi>Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyglaſſes</hi> masked viſage thus. If where our aduerſarie thought to finde moſt matter of aduantage, he hath wearied himſelfe in his vaine cauilling courſe, and yet neither found vntruth, nor corruption, but rather contrariwiſe plaine and honeſt dealing; I hope all moderat papiſts (for of others I make no queſtion) will neither ſuſpect my dealing without cauſe, nor beléeue ſuch vaine clamorous compagnions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due proofe. Againe if <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> with his broade eyes, notwithſtanding all his diligence and endeuour, could not finde in ſo many authorities, as I alleadged, any iuſt ſubiect of ſclander; it is a great argument, that he could not well take exception to the reſt of my diſcourſe. For it is a méere ſimplicitie to thinke, that he would haue ſpared me in any thing, if he could haue taken me at any aduantage, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath cried out ſo lowde vpon no aduantage, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified his moſt idle and friuolous conceits, being nothing but the flatuous blaſte of a frantike maſſeprieſt. Let all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts therefore beware, how they truſt ſuch clamorous and ſlipperie companions.</p>
               <p>He noteth further, <hi>that I would be loth to haue theſe points examined before any learned auditorie.</hi> But how much he is abuſed, and preſumeth to abuſe his reader, may well appeare by my former anſwere, where not onely before a fewe, but before the whole world I haue anſwered all his vaine obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>I doe alſo further promiſe him, God ſending me life, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to faile him, as oft as he ſhal dare to come forth againſt me in like triall. But, I beléeue, he poore ideot will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere my obiections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for hee hath already fled out of the liſtes, and fayled to anſwere ſuch falſifications, as I haue in
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18442:145"/> my anſwere to <hi>Parſons</hi> relation obiected againſt him, and his conſorts.</p>
               <p>He doth in the ende of this obſeruation againe deſire me, <hi>to procure him a free conference.</hi> but what ſhall that néede, when I yéeld him more, then is deſired? Notwithſtanding, if he thinke to winne any thing at my hands by conference; let him procure me firſt a frée conference at <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca;</hi> and I doe promiſe to procure him a frée conference at <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford.</hi> In the meane while I pray him, I prouoke him, I by all means vrge him to anſwere in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch lies, as I auerre his conſorts to haue made, and to cleare the Church of Rome, and her principall proctors of ſuch notorious falſifications, as I ſay they haue committed. If he be not able, as indéede I take him to be altogither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, let <hi>Robert Parſons, Frier Garnet,</hi> or the <hi>Archprieſt</hi> anſwere, and maintaine the quarrell which this idle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnion hath begun. And let them ſet their names to their writings, and come foorth with bare faces, that wee may know, what they are we deale with, and not as hitherto, fight with <hi>N.D.E.O.</hi> and ſuch like hollowe fellowes, and meere ſhadowes. If not, let them aſſure themſelues; I wil by publike writing diſcouer ſuch a packe of impoſtures, lies, falſifications, villanies, and treaſons committed by <hi>Rob.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith and learning both one (as if his conſorts, that take themſelues to be learned, were alſo faithfull chriſtians) and teacheth, that the controuerſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18442:145"/> 
                  <hi>falſifications</hi> and <hi>vntruthes</hi> obiected by him, toucheth faith and not fact, as if we did not as well contend about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, as faith in this idle quarell begonne by our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, and wherein the ſtate of the mayne controuerſie is, whether I haue ſpoken vntruth or not, and whether I haue falſified any authors alledged by me, or not.</p>
               <p>Secondly if no credit be giuen to thoſe, that tell lyes and falſifie authors, as <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> affirmeth; then by his ſentence we are not to beléeue, either the pope of Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e. or his agents, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt notorius lyers &amp; falſifirrs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer the world ſuſtained. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine if no credit be to be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto my diſcourſe concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> packing &amp; trechery of his conſorts, why doth he not anſwere me, and conuince mee of vntruth? And what reaſon hath he to deſire his readers, not to beleeue that, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is not able to controule? Is not ſuch a bald compagni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aſhamed, to take to him as much authority as the Pope. that all the generation of antichriſte is to beleeue vpon his owne bare word?</p>
               <p>Thirdly if all his idle obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s concerning pretended cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and falſifications he ſo cleared, as that I looke for no more anſwere of ſo naſtie a diſputer as this <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> is; then it can be no credit for him to cry ſo loud, or to vſe theſe odious and ſlaundrous termes of <hi>corruptions.</hi> and <hi>falſificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> but he ought rather to looke downe vpon his owne, and his conſorts filthy factes, then to pinche at others me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s faultes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly if the papiſtes his clients be ſo cleare, as he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them, why doth he not anſwere for them playnly and honeſtly refuting euery point of my charge? If they be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie why doth he not rayle a ſpirt at <hi>Rob. Parſons,</hi> that ſo fooliſhly brought them forth to this triall, and there left them to ſpeake for themſelues?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>if he liſt not to excuſe any Papiſt for the cariage of his life,</hi> as he confeſſeth, what reaſon hath he to blame me if I vpon ſo iuſt occaſions giuen me by that rinegat, and falſe traytor <hi>Rob Parſons</hi> haue toulde them ſome parte of their faultes?</p>
               <p>Sixtly if he will not haue my verdict admitted againſt his clients, though conuinced by playne euidence &amp; witneſſe, he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:18442:146"/> hath no reaſon to require, that the verdict of <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> a moſt notorious and infamous libeller, and a knowne and profeſſed traytor, and an infamous perſon conuicted by his owne wicked and treaſonable writings, and by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his owne conſorts, or the accuſations of ſuch libellers, as <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> and ſuch worthleſſe and nameleſſe fellowes ſhould be admitted or receiued. Againe if he wil haue nothing to be affirmed without authenticall teſtimony &amp; proofe; then muſt he and his malicious mates forbeare to ſend forth ſo many vaine and fabulous pamphlets.</p>
               <p>7. Further if hee charge me hereafter with wilfull and witting falſification, as he ſticketh not very boldly and often to doe; then muſt he proue firſt <hi>falſification,</hi> then this quality of wilfull knowledge: wherof hytherto he hath done neither againe, if I obiect that to him which he cannot deny; then modeſty would require, that he ſhould confeſſe; &amp; ſhame force him not to defend any more matters knowne notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to be falſe.</p>
               <p>8. If hee take to himſelfe and his conſorts the name of <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> and will néedes charge me <hi>with a ſetled malice, and deſperat reſolution againſt the Catholike Church,</hi> he muſt proue two thinges. Firſt that Popiſh religion is the ancient catholike religion; and next, that I oppugne the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith. Vnles he doe this, his reader will take him for a lewd begging compagnion, that taketh that for granted, that is in controuerſie, and we muſt accompt him for a paltry fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that is not able to anſwere our arguments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we proue that Popiſh religion, which we refuſe, is neither catholike, nor ancient.</p>
               <p>9. If boldly and falſely he will denie that our faith hath had continuance and ſucceſſion from Chriſts time, and challeng both to himſelfe; he muſt then deny, that the faith taught in the Apoſtles créede, and eſtabliſhed in the fowre firſt general counſels, and contained and grounded vpon the holy canonicall ſcriptures, hath alwayes continued ſince Chriſts time, and hath had continuall ſucceſſion vntill our dayes. And to prooue the Popiſh faith, he muſt ſhew, that the Apoſtles taught, and that the holy fathers beléeued, Firſt that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18442:146"/> Chriſt had a body inuiſible and impalpable, and that might be in heauen and earth and many diſtant places all at one time. ſecondly, that Chriſts body did not fill the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was. 3. That accidentes may ſubſiſt without foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, or ſubiect. 4, that préeſtes may celebrate maſſe without communion. 5, that the préeſtes may take away the cuppe of the newe teſtament from Gods people. 6, that chriſtians are to worſhip the croſſe, and the ſacrament with <hi>Latria,</hi> or diuine worſhip. 7, that the préeſt doth offer vp the true body and bloud of Chriſt to God the Father for the ſinnes of quicke and dead. 8, that chriſtians are iuſtified by greaſing, which they call extreme vnction and by all other Romiſh ſacraments. 9, that the Diuell is coniured out by the blaſphemous Romiſh exorciſmes. 10. that the pope is head and monarch of the Church. 11, that it is ſinne to eate fleſh vpon imbre dayes. 12, that the popes decrées are the foundation of the faith, and other ſuch like points of popiſh doctrine,</p>
               <p>10. If hee, be not able really, and playnly either to iuſtifie his owne cauſe, or to diſproue ours; as he walketh by night himſelfe, ſo he may do well to keepe his conceits ſecret, and to talke of them by night rather then by day. credit he can winne none by his vaine babling, rayling or lying.</p>
               <p>Finally, either let him acquit himſelfe like a braue fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or els deſiſt from his odious termes, <hi>of odious ſtuffe, paued faces, deſperat dealing, treachery, legerdermain;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 86.87.82.</note> 
                  <hi>falſe packing, crafty conueyance, filthie fardle of fowle lyes,</hi> and ſuch like. And let him not thinke, that he ſhall winne any thing with ſuch courſes. For nothing can be deuiſed more odious and deſperate, then the cauſe of the wicked préeſtes of <hi>Baal.</hi> Neither did euer any ſect vſe more cogging, iugling, or lewd impoſtures, then the Papiſtes. to conclude this point, nothing is more eaſie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to declaime againſt the Pope, and the préeſtes of <hi>Baal,</hi> and their impoſtures, fraudes, vilenyes, ſuperſtitions, trecheries, blaſphemies, and all their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. I would therefore aduiſe this paltry fellow to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he giue me not iuſt occaſion to take the like courſe againſt his conſorts. I aſſure him, I ſhall make all the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18442:147"/> packe of them infamous to poſteritie.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond obſeruation he ſaith further, <hi>that hee will touch one lye of mine,</hi> and that he ſaith, <hi>is knowne to be one, both to Spayne and Italy.</hi> But vnleſſe <hi>Spayne</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> doe vnderſtand Engliſh in which toung I wrote, it can hardly be knowne to theſe two countries; vnleſſe by <hi>Spayne</hi> and <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> he vnderſtand baſtardly and vnnatural rinegat Engliſh, which are either Italianated, or turned Turke or <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> beſide that it muſt néeds be a ſtrangelye, that hath filled two ſo great contries, and not vnlike their phantaſticall <hi>corpus domini,</hi> that is really in <hi>Spayne</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> and euery altar, as the Papiſh fanſie, at one time. Let vs therefore heare him tell this wondrous lye, and by his teſtimony the only lye of all my booke ſet out againſt theſe lying and traytorous <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deword,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Page, 84.</note> framed by <hi>Robert Parſons.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>that I affirme, that Cardinall Allen was in the Spaniſh armado</hi> (he ſhould ſay <hi>armada) in the yeare</hi> 1588, <hi>and that I repeat it diuers times, and namely</hi> (as he quoteth in the margent) <hi>reply. p.</hi> 61. <hi>p.</hi> 98. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 110. But what if I did not once name the <hi>Spaniſh armada,</hi> when I talke of <hi>Allans</hi> comming againſt his contry? was not this lying companion armed with a Vizor of impudency, where he talketh of lying, to lye ſo groſſely? I hope his beſt frends will not deny it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well then let vs ſée what my words are, that <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> taketh hold on. I ſay in my reply. <hi>p.</hi> 62. that <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1588. <hi>diuers rinegat Engliſh, and among the reſt Cardinall Allen came with the Spaniardes to fight againſt their countrie.</hi> I ſay againe <hi>pag.</hi> 98. <hi>that Cardinall came with the Spaniardes anno.</hi> 1588. <hi>With fire and ſword to deſtroy this lande.</hi> In my challenge <hi>p.</hi> 110. I ſay, <hi>cardinall Allen, and not ſo little as a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred preiſtes came with the Spaniſh army.</hi> And out of theſe words he gathereth, that I ſay, he was in the <hi>ſpaniſh armada</hi> but he was blind, that could not ſée, that there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt an army, and an <hi>armada,</hi> that ſignifieth a fléete; betwixt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> forces, and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> fléete. And a great wonder it is, that an hiſpaniolized engliſh maſſe préeſt ſhould no better vnderſtand, either ſpaniſh or Engliſh. Although then, it were true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> was not in the fléete: yet was he to come with the Spaniſh <hi>Armie.</hi> Neither is there
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18442:147"/> any vntruth in my wordes, as appeareth by the teſtimony of <hi>Allen</hi> himſelfe in his wicked libell, <hi>to the nobilitie and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of England and Ireland,</hi> where he writeth thus. <note place="margin">I hope euerie man will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue Allen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his owne words, before the baſe fellow our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie, that was not priuy to all his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus much my good Lords and deare friends, I haue thought good to forewarne you, of the whole cauſe of theſe preſent ſacred warres, and of his holineſſe, and Catholike maieſties ſincere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention therein, &amp; both their incomparable affections towards our nation: whereof I could giue you farre more comfortable intelligence, if I were perſonally preſent with you, as I truſt I ſhall be verie ſhortly. For that is fully meant by his holineſſe, and by his maieſtie, and of me ſo much deſired, that euerie ſhort day ſeemeth a long yeare, till I enioy you in our Lord.</hi> Note I pray you, that by the Popes ſpeciall appointment and the king of Spaines good liking, that vnnaturall Cardinal was to come with the Spaniſh army againſt his countrey. Note alſo, how much this traytor deſired this inuaſion, and howe that he thought euery ſhort day a yeare, vntill it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.</p>
               <p>He ſaith alſo, <hi>that the Pope preferred him to a high functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, intending to ſend him, as his legat with full commiſſion and commandement to treate, and deale from time to time, as well with the ſtates of the Realme, as with his holineſſe and the kings maieſtie for the ſweeter managing of this godly, and great affaire.</hi> Doe you not ſée, and is it not plaine by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals owne confeſſion, that this ſwéete Cardinall was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a principall commander in that ſwéete action, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſwéetly intended to cut our throates? And yet this ſowre varlet in ſowre termes giueth me the lie, for making him one of theſe inuadors, that meant to deſtroy this our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue countrey, which all honeſt men (of which <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> is none) with all their power ought to defend againſt ſuch trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as <hi>Allen</hi> was.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18442:148"/> perſon to the army; yet was he of the army, and to come with it, as appeareth, not onely by his owne wordes but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by the teſtimony of many others, that well knew it, and in not comming, he was to be taken as a deſertor, and ſo to be puniſhed. But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he that was in the way towards <hi>England,</hi> and when he heard of the diſcomfiture of the Spaniſh fleete, turned aſide to wéepe at <hi>Grotta Ferrata,</hi> deſeruing rather to be ſtrangled as a traytor in <hi>Cauea Ferrata,</hi> then to take the freſh ayre at <hi>Grotta Ferrata,</hi> if that were materiall, it will be verified by diuers prieſts, if they be asked on their othes. Why any man ſhould beléeue this lying compagnion, that ſpeaketh without proofe or probabilitie; there is neither co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, nor cauſe.</p>
               <p>He excepteth alſo againſt that, which I ſay <hi>of the number of Prieſts,</hi> that were likewiſe to come with the Spaniſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and thinketh <hi>that a hundred Prieſts could not then bee found; there being then but two Seminaries, Rome, and Rhemes, and not aboue fiftie in both.</hi> But he ſhould be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent fellow, that could perſwade me to beléeue that lying mate without all proofe. Why I ſhould beleeue the contrary I can alleadge good reaſons. For <hi>firſt,</hi> this being the ende of the erection of the Seminaries, to reduce England vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the Popes yoke; we are not to doubt, but that all the Engliſh of the Seminaries ſhould haue béene emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that action, and the whole ſinke of treaſon let out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> albeit in the Seminaries there were not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prieſts to be found; yet might that number haue béene filled vp by diuers other prieſts, that liued here and there diſperſed. Her Maieſty hauing diſmiſſed and baniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue fiftie prieſts, that deſerued death by her lawes rather then baniſhment, not paſt two or thrée yeares before. Theſe therefore and others ſhould haue come into England. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would that barking curre <hi>Stapleton</hi> haue fayled, if he could haue ſéene opportunitie to hurt thoſe, againſt which he had ſo long barked. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> diuers prieſts now in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, that many prieſts were to come with the Spaniſh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Finally, <hi>Allen</hi> in his wicked libell reporteth, that prieſts came with the Spaniſh forces <hi>to ſerue euerie mans
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18442:148"/> ſpirituall neceſſities.</hi> But how could that be, vnleſſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were competent? Among the reſt I am enformed, that <hi>R. Parſons</hi> ſhould haue come with his aſſiſtants, and whole councell of reformation, and that to auoide idleneſſe in the meane time he holpe to write and publiſh the moſt wicked declaration of <hi>Sixtus quintus</hi> againſt her Maieſtie. It may be alſo, <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> had an ore, if not in the fléete, yet in the army, or els was in England to attend the comming of it. Let him therefore thanke God, that he is not ſought out, and puniſhed as a traytor, that endeuoureth to plead the cauſe of traytors. And let all indifferent men iudge, whether I haue not ſaid truely, and he moſt falſely, both concerning <hi>Allen,</hi> and the Prieſts.</p>

                  <hi>nor pare nor pole the venerable ſentences of antiquitie, nor a man of learning frame ſuch arguments, as flie ouer his aduerſaries, and may be driuen backe vpon his owne head.</hi> And this he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſtanding vpon his tiptoes, and looking vpon himſelfe very prowdly, and verily beléeuing, that he hath ſpoken ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry brauely, and almoſt eloquently. But if he had better loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vpon himſelfe, his conſcience, and cauſe; he would haue extended more fauour to vs his poore friends, himſelfe being a ſot of 24. carats, and deuoid of all learning and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, hauing giuen proofe of his learning in his miſerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and hauing his conſcience grounded on the caſes of conſcience reſolued by <hi>Allen</hi> and <hi>Parſons,</hi> and <hi>Peter Nauarrus,</hi> that teach men againſt all conſcience to play the villaines; and ſo a man ſtand for the Pope, to ſweare and forſweare; and finally to doe what a man liſt, ſo he haue the Popes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties for it. And what face had he to talke of ſinceritie, his cauſe ſtanding vpon falſifying of fathers, lying of legends, counterfaiting traditions, rayling vpon innocents, cogging
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18442:149"/> of fabulous hiſtories, and vpon deuiſing of fraudes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures to abuſe the world? His want of learning, I ſay, is proued by his weake and baſe talent of writing, wherein it appeareth he could not ſo much, as tell how to frame a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or how to vnderſtand the things he handleth. Allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging but two words of latin pag. 30. he ſheweth he can no latin, vſing the plurall for the ſingular, ſaying <hi>prope initia,</hi> where a latiniſt would haue ſaid <hi>prope initium,</hi> or rather <hi>in principio.</hi> quoting one verſe he marreth it pag. 4. his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are <hi>Hierom Verduſſen,</hi> and Engliſh almanacks, ſuch proofes as a man may haue three or foure for a groate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his arguments are ſuch, as I haue declared in my anſwere. His want of conſcience may, I ſay, appeare by the moſt damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſolutions of caſes of conſcience of <hi>Nauarrus,</hi> and other Romiſh caſuiſtes, and eſpecially the reſolutions of <hi>Allen</hi> and <hi>Parſons,</hi>

               <p>This alſo doth touch the cauſe of poperie in generall. for if a good cauſe néede not to be ſupported with lies, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; then is the Popes cauſe very bad, that cannot ſtande without lies. If a good conſcience will not be ſtrayned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the limits of truth and ſinceritie, <hi>nor pare nor pole the venerable ſentences of antiquitie;</hi> then hath <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Parſons</hi> no good conſcience. For <hi>Parſons</hi> maketh no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to tell any lies, as I haue prooued in my anſwere to his woodden <hi>wardword,</hi> and the prieſtes haue notoriouſly proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in all their bookes againſt him, and his trecherous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Againe, then haue the <hi>Iebuſites</hi> no conſcience, that lie and falſifie according to the rules of their order, and that moſt ſhamefully, <note place="margin">Le catechiſme de Ieſuites.</note> as is proued in <hi>their Catechiſme.</hi> Thirdly,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18442:149"/> then hath the Pope no conſcience, that by his lewde, and trecherous indexes, and by his Talmudicall traditions, and peruerſe expoſitions, hath taken a courſe to corrupt both ſcriptures and fathers. If they haue no learning, whoſe arguments conclude not effectually, but may be retorted backe vpon the faces of the proponentes; then if <hi>Owly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe</hi> be iudge, neither hath <hi>Bellarmine</hi> nor <hi>Stapleton</hi> any learning. For in diuers of our treatiſes, we haue made their arguments, to rebound backe vpon them.</p>
               <p>As for my ſelfe, I referre my cauſe to be tried by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different man, that ſhall reade <hi>Owlyglaſſes</hi> obiections and my anſweres. My conſcience, and plaine dealing the iudge of all mens conſciences doth beſt knowe, and I hope all the courſe of my writings will iuſtifie againſt all the cauils of ſuch vaine banglers. My learning, I acknowledge, is not comparable to that, which many of my brethren haue, but yet I hope by the grace of God to maintaine a truth againſt the prowdeſt of the Popiſh faction. But were it neuer ſo ſclender; yet vntill my bookes againſt <hi>Bellarmine</hi> be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in that plaine and ſcholaſticall ſort, that I doe anſwere him; neither hath <hi>Owlyglaſſe,</hi> nor any of his conſorts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſon to deſpiſe it, or to obiect want of learning vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</p>
               <p>Yet ſéeing hee doth vndertake to prooue, that I haue no learning; let vs ſée, whether <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> hath any better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in this, then in his former allegations concerning his ſuppoſed <hi>vntruthes</hi> and <hi>falſifications.</hi> Firſt he ſaith, <hi>I bring ſuch arguments to prooue the Papiſts to be no Catholikes, and to maintaine new doctrine, and hereſie, as touch not them, but wound the Church of England.</hi> But if this had béen ſo, why doth not <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> vndertake to anſwere my arguments? why doth he not dare to refute my diſcourſe? If they hurt the Church of England, no doubt, but ſuch caterpillers as he, that ſéeke our hurt and ruine, would not haue omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to take that aduantage. His wordes therefore are but vaine bragges, and néede no other refutation then his owne lewde performance in this encounter, and déepe ſilence in the reſt.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:18442:150"/>
               <p>Next he ſaith, <hi>he will take a ſcantling of my learning, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing anſwerable to my lookes, and countenance.</hi> But his ſcantling is very ſhort, and vnproportionable, being but one onely argument. Beſide that, it <hi>ſheweth, that both learning and honeſtie</hi> is very ſcant with him. for where I go about to prooue, that the Church of Rome is not the true church of Chriſt, <hi>for that it wanteth true biſhops, and Prieſts,</hi> the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey fellow onely repeateth my wordes, whereby I prooue, that euery true Church hath true biſhops and prieſts, but durſt not ſet downe my wordes, whereby I ſhewe, <hi>that the Church of Rome hath neither true biſhoppes, nor prieſts.</hi> And where he toucheth any reaſon of mine, he marreth it with his lewde handling, and mangleth my whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, omitting my thrée laſt reaſons, and not daring to ſet them downe. I will therefore now let the ignorant ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot knowe, that my reaſons, whereby I conclude, that the Church of Rome hath no true biſhops nor prieſtes at this time, are ſtrong and effectuall, and that his cauillations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my words, are vaine and friuolous.</p>
               <p>Firſt then I ſay, that no man hath ordinarie power to ordaine biſhops or prieſtes, but he that is a biſhop and a prieſt. But the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> is neither true biſhop, nor prieſt. <hi>ergo.</hi> the propoſition our aduerſarie denyeth not. The aſſumption I prooue by theſe arguments. Firſt the Pope was ordained prieſt, but to offer ſacrifices, and to ſay maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for quicke and dead. But neither doth this ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on make a prieſt, nor had true prieſts and elders euer any ſuch ordination. That this ordination doth not make a prieſt, I prooue, for that thereby the ordained neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue power to preach, nor to adminiſter the ſacraments, nor the keyes of the Church, wherein prieſthood conſiſteth. If they receiue any thing, it is to offer ſacrifice. But the Papiſts confeſſe, that there is great difference betwixt the ſacrament of the Euchariſt, and a ſacrifice, as appeareth by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> large diſputes. <note place="margin">Lib. 1. &amp; 2. de ſacrif. miſſae.</note> Further, this ordination doth not giue to prieſtes the right of apoſtolicall ſucceſſion, which conſiſteth in preaching, and adminiſtring the ſacraments, which our Sauiour committed to his Apoſtles, and their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18442:150"/> ſucceſſours to the worldes ende, as appeareth by Chriſts wordes <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. that prieſts in auncient time neuer had any ſuch ordination, it appeareth by the commiſſion, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> gaue to his Apoſtles <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. by the office of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors deſcribed <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. and 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. where no mention is made of ſacrificing for quicke and dead. neither doth this clauſe, <hi>hoc facite,</hi> in any author ſignifie, <hi>ſacrifice for quicke and dead.</hi> It appeareth alſo by monuments of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and auncient formularies. In the 4. Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> prieſts are ordained by impoſition of hands, but not to ſacrifice for quicke and dead. This argument our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie for all his contemptuous ſpéeches of my arguments durſt not once touch.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Pope is not ordained, to teach or gouerne a certaine flocke, but to be the <hi>vniuerſall biſhop,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 2. de pontif. Rom. c. 31. Prooem. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> the <hi>head of the Church,</hi> the <hi>ſpouſe of the Church,</hi> the <hi>foundation of the Church,</hi> and a little demy god vpon the earth, with power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer purgatorie, and the keyes of heauen, and hell. And if he haue not this power; then is he not Pope. But this power is no where deliuered by any good commiſſion to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. nor doth it belong to any biſhop, for any thing we can yet learne. for if it did, then ſhould all biſhops haue that power. <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> therefore may doe well, to ſhewe vs this power out of ſcriptures and fathers. or els his ſilence will teach him, that the Pope is no biſhop. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs of, <hi>paſce oues meas:</hi> and, <hi>tibi dabo claues.</hi> But he muſt finde out a better commiſſion for the Pope. or els all biſhops will haue like power, and the pope will prooue to haue no power, vnleſſe he féede, and haue the keyes of the Church. which by <hi>Owlyglaſſe,</hi> I am aſſured will not bee proued.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Pope doth not féede the flocke by teaching, or adminiſter the ſacraments, or gouerne the Church, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther biſhops did, but contrariwiſe taketh vpon him to be Emperour, or gouernour of Rome, which the auncient biſhops of Rome neuer did. But no man can be a King, and a biſhop both together: nor a biſhop without doing the office of a biſhop. For <hi>Epiſcopatus,</hi> as the Apoſtle teacheth

                     </gap>os.</hi> Our aduerſarie anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>that it is Donatiſme to affirme, that the efficacie of ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doth depend vpon the good, or bad life of the miniſters, and that we are to harken to thoſe, that ſit in Moyſes his chaire, albeit they be Phariſees, and bad men otherwiſe.</hi> And this he proueth by diuers teſtimonies out of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and the harmony of our confeſſions, being copious, where no néede is, and ſilent when he ſhould anſwere. But all this is no more to purpoſe, then if he ſhould tell vs a tale of a horſe neſt, or of the popes mules and mulets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for what is that to me, or others, that ſay not, that the Pope or popiſh biſhops are not lawfull biſhops, nor haue power to adminiſter ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, becauſe they are <hi>Sodomites,</hi> adulterers, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, but rather, that the pope is no biſhop at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not <hi>opus epiſcopi?</hi> He will perhaps ſay, he doth <hi>opus epiſcopi.</hi> But then he muſt ſhewe, that he fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the flocke by teaching, and that he doth adminiſter the ſacraments of the Lords ſupper, and baptiſme orderly, and ordinarily as other biſhops doe: wherein I beléeue he will faile.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I haue proued, that the pope is <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced aboue all, that is called God, and the principall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarke of Antichriſts kingdome. But light and darkeneſſe ſhall as ſoone concurre, as the tyrannie of Antichriſt, and the office of a biſhop in one perſon. I haue prooued, that he is <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in my fift booke <hi>de Pontifice Rom.</hi> againſt <hi>Bellar.</hi> which becauſe he ſo aboundeth in learning, and I haue none, I would pray him to anſwere with his great learning, and eſpecially ſéeing it maketh ſo much for the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of his father the pope, that begot him on a ſtrumpet the hore of Babylon, his maſhips mother. A braue fellow he is, no doubt, that is ſo well borne of father and mother. And if his ſtomack wil brooke no latin, let him refute my anſwere to <hi>Parſons wardword;</hi> if not all, yet ſo much as toucheth the Pope.</p>
               <p>Finally, the Pope is an heretike, an apoſtata, and a moſt notorious ſimoniacal perſon, entring by brigues, and faction, and compoſition with the Spaniſh king, and cardinals, as is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18442:151"/> notorious to the world, and appeareth in euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>claue, and is not diſſembled by popiſh writers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſuch by cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, albeit otherwiſe biſhops, are ſuſpended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ordaining biſhops, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferring orders. That they are heretikes it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, vnleſſe <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> can ſhew, that the points we haue handled in the 4. chapter of our former diſcourſe, are no he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies; which if he be able to ſhew, I doubt not, but the pope for his paynes will make him cardinall. That the Pops are apoſtatates, it apeareth for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue declined from the an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cient faith, as I haue likewiſe declared in my former chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge. That they are ſimoniacal creatures, their buying and ſelling of the papacy, and of all eccleſiaſticall liuings, of maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of ſacraments, of faculties, doth manifeſtly declare, and that this is a common fault of Popes, it appeareth by their <hi>rules of chancerie</hi> by the <hi>Penitentiaries taxe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Vid. regul. Cancellar. &amp; paenitent.</note> by the gloſſes of their canons, by <hi>Albericus de Roſate in verbo, Roma:</hi> by <hi>Theodorica Niems</hi> treatiſe of ſchiſme, by <hi>baptiſt of Mantua,</hi> and all ſtories, that write any truth. Neither is this a faulte of late crept into that ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dabis mihi de tota maxima vrbe</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard lib.</hi> 4 <hi>de conſid. ad Eugenium, quite in papam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceperit pretio, ſeu ſpe pretij non interueniente?</hi> He ſignifieth, <hi>that the Pope was choſen by ſimony,</hi> without ſimony certes no cardinall can ſée to finde the Popes chayre.</p>
               <p>By this it may alſo appeare, that the Romiſh church hath no true biſhops, or prieſtes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for firſt they are ordained by the Pope, that is no biſhop. <hi>Secondly</hi> the Biſhops neither preach nor adminiſter the ſacraments, nor accompt that any parte of their epiſcopall function. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Pope <hi>Ioane</hi> had noe power to ordeine Biſhops or prieſtes being a woman. But all that haue liued in the Church of Rome along time haue béene ordeined by none, but ſuch as were ordeined by her, or by biſhops that were made by her. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> all préeſts are ordeined to ſacrifice for quicke &amp; dead. As appeareth by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabeus, in lib. de miſſis epiſcoporum pro ordinibus conferen dis. Bellarmine</hi> alſo ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> preiſtes are made by theſe words, <hi>accipe poteſtatem offerendi ſacrificlum:</hi> that is, <hi>receiue power to offer ſacrifice.</hi> Which is no ſufficient ordination, nor gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth préeſtes power either to preach or adminiſter ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18442:152"/> but rather a power in ancient time neuer belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to préeſts, as I haue proued againſt <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in my booke <hi>de ſacrificio miſſae. Fiftly</hi> no ſimoniacall perſons or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes haue power to order others; and if they doe it, their ordination by canons is declared voyd, &amp; they are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced irreguler<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this I thinke <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> will not deny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he will anſwere percaſe that the Popiſh biſhops are neither heretikes, nor ſimonicall perſons let him therefore, if he will make his anſwere good, make anſwere to my obiections con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the hereſies, and ſimonyes of the Church of Rome. <hi>Sixtly,</hi> the popiſh biſhops are all ſlaues of Antichriſt, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by their ſlauiſh oth. <hi>c. ego. N. de iureiurando.</hi> If then the pope be proued <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the aduerſary of Chriſt, and his Church: his adherents ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be déemed true biſhops. <hi>Finally,</hi> albeit the Popiſh Church had a certaine forme of ordination, and biſhops and préeſtes ſo called; yet nether can the ordination be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted lawful being contrary to canons nor can they be déemed true biſhops and prieſts, that neither preach that, which Chriſt commanded, nor obſerue his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, nor adminiſter the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts according to Chriſts inſtitution. Oftentimes alſo the Pope hath ordeined boyes, ignorant perſons vtterly vncapable of epiſcopall function, biſhops and preeſts. And ſuch being ſo ordeined neuer did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of miniſteriall function, if then the Romiſh Church be like her biſhops; then as ſhe hath falſe and defectiue biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, ſo is ſhee a falſe and defectiue Church. But ſaith <hi>Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyglaſſe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>the councell of Trent hath made ſuch holſome decrees, concerning the diligent and often teaching and preaching of bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and preeſts, as Maſter Sutcliffe can finde no iuſt cauſe of complainte.</hi> But if he had let downe theſe wholſome decrées, he would haue béene much aſhamed of the decrées themſelues and more of the ſlender exequution of them. For <hi>Concil. Trid. Seſſ.</hi> 5, <hi>c.</hi> 2. they decrée, <hi>that biſhops ſhall teach by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, or others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Beſide that we doe not reade, that the firſt biſhops of Rome, did preach by others, or ſet vp louzy fryers, to prate in pulpits as now is the faſhion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. Our
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18442:152"/> Sauiour Chriſt bad his Diſciples preach themſelues, or els he would not haue ſent them. And S. <hi>Peter</hi> preacheth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and vſed no deputation for the matter, as now the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſtes</hi> doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> furthermore now the execution of this lawe is ſo neglected, that I doe not beléeue, that <hi>Owlyglaſſe,</hi> albeit he hath well frequented all corners of Rome, hath heard the pope preach. And when the old <hi>Cardinall</hi> of Lorrein offerd to preach, he was derided for his labor, of all his compagnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ſo vnſéemly a thing it ſéemeth for a <hi>Cardinal,</hi> &amp; biſhop to preach.</p>
               <p>He anſwereth further. <hi>That I would be loth that our church ſhould continue no longer, then biſhops doe their duties in preaching and feeding.</hi> But he doth wrong our biſhops to compare them to Romiſh prelats, that neither preach, nor thinke that preaching belongeth to them, and for the moſt parte, vnleſſe it be ſome frier or foxe inroabed with biſhops apparell, preach not, nor ſpeake more then ſtockes and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Churches. He doth alſo miſtake me much, if he thinke, that I conclude, that any congregation is not the true church, where biſhops doe not their duties. For that is no part of my meaning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I ſay, that the true Church cannot longe want true biſhopes, and teachers, and that therfore the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church is not the true Church, hauing no biſhops, nor préeſtes at all, but in name. And that I proued, for that they wanted true prieſthood, and true ordination, and were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned and ſent by antichriſt, by heretikes and ſimoniacall perſons, and ſuch as had no authority to ordayne, or ſende forth biſhops and preeſtes.</p>
               <p>He anſwereth finally, <hi>that I haue no reaſon to carpe at the Romiſh clergie for their bad life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lacke of learning, ſeeing,</hi>

               <p>Hauing anſwered according to his beſt ſkill, and broken as he thinketh all our bonds, like <hi>Dalilaes</hi> cords (though ſome of his friends ſay, that a certeine <hi>Dalila</hi> hath ſtrong hold of him) he goeth about to retort this argument vpon vs, and ſaith: <hi>if the true Church hath alwayes true biſhops and preeſts, that the Church of England,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pag 100.</note> 
                  <hi>is not the true Church, as wanting true preeſtes and biſhops.</hi> And with this argument hee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth to <hi>giue vs ſuch a drie ſhauing,</hi> as he doubteth not, <hi>but he will marre the whole beauty thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but he ſheweth himſelfe to be but a ſimple barber, and a worſe drie ſhauer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for nowe he cannot ſhew, but that we haue true biſhops, hauing both lawfull ordination, and our biſhops exequuting the office of biſhops loyally, and orderly. Before this reformation alſo our biſhops had all that, which our aduerſaries thinke neceſſary in the outward calling of biſhops. Beſides that there fayled not among our biſhops and préeſtes at all times diuers men, which deteſted the abominations of the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtes,</hi> as <hi>Robert Groſted</hi> biſhop of <hi>Lincolne, Richard Vllerſton</hi> that liued about the councell of <hi>Conſtance, Iohn wicleffe</hi> and diuers others. But ſaith he, <hi>who layd hands on biſhop Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</hi> He ſéemeth alſo to make the like queſtion of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius.</hi> I anſwere that biſhop <hi>Couerdale</hi> and <hi>Skory,</hi> and others which were biſhops in King Edwardes time layde hands vpon biſhop <hi>Parker.</hi> I confeſſe alſo, that biſhop <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> had an externall calling, though corrupt, &amp; in a corrupt ſtate, yet ſuch as <hi>Owlygalſſe</hi> dare not deny to be ſufficient. And beſide that externall calling, it pleaſed God to reuele to them his will extraordinarily, and to call them out of <hi>Babylon</hi> to the knowledge of his truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our aduerſary therefore of all men hath leaſt reaſon to challenge them for their calling. Beſide that he cannot conclude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that externall calling was then thought ſufficient, that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18442:153"/> now the popiſh Church hath a calling ſufficient. For albeit the préeſtes of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> that worſhiped <hi>Baal,</hi> had an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall calling, which was not diſabled, when they returned to the true worſhip of God; yet was not their Idolatrous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice doon to <hi>Baal,</hi> nor that preeſthood lawful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the like wee may ſay of maſſe préeſts. They ſhould haue ſerued God aright, yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſerued at their maſſing alters, they worſhipped ſtrange Gods. But when they left their Idolatrie, then their calling tooke effect they doing that, for which they were prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipally called. Furthermore he cannot ſay, becauſe now all Idolatry and ſuperſtition being abandoned, we are the true church, that the papiſts that reteine ſtill their ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are the true church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true church is tryed by true faith, true worſhip, and ſeruice of God, &amp; not by externall rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and ſucceſſion without Gods true worſhip or the true faith. <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> would alſo gladly haue me <hi>to ſet down the names of thoſe biſhops, that gouerned our Church euer ſince Chriſt.</hi> As if all biſhops, that mayntained the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles créede, and catholike faith, were not our biſhops. If they digreſſed from the faith, we are not to ſéeke for a new ranke of biſhops, but to acknowledge them to be true biſhops, that profeſſed the true faith. He talketh alſo of my being at <hi>Cales,</hi> but it is more honeſty for me to goe in the ſeruice of my Prince and contry againſt forreine enemies, then for him with forreine enemies like a diſloyal traytor to fight againſt his prince and contry, and like a baſe ſlaue to ſerue the popes turne. And this may ſerue to iuſtifie my argument againſt the popiſh préeſthood.</p>
               <p>It reſteth now, that I anſwere his friuolous obiections concerning ſome points which he ſuppoſeth to conteine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of contradiction: which he vanteth, that hee will handle <hi>to the little commendation of my learning,</hi> as he ſaith. But if he would indéede haue diſgraced me, he ſhould haue taken in hand the aunſwere of ſome latine treatiſe which I haue pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed againſt <hi>Bellar.</hi> For therein he might haue ſhewed ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whereas this diſcourſe concerning falſifications and vntruthes is nothing but a little fardle of foolery, and a vaine bable for his clients to ſport themſelues with all. Well in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18442:154"/> the meane while let vs know his worſhips pleaſure concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe ſuppoſed <hi>contradictions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt he chargeth me with ſaying, <hi>that the number of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſacraments was not certainly eſtabliſhed, nor receiued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the late councell of Trent:</hi> and this he ſuppoſeth to be contrarie to that, which I affirme in another place, viz. <hi>that the iuſt number of ſeuen ſacraments, and neither more nor leſſe, was firſt deliuered by the councell of Florence vnder Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius the fourth, and afterward confirmed by the councell of Trent.</hi> But the poore ideot doth rather bewray his owne ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, that knew not how this doctrine of ſeuen ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments crept into the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church, and great dulneſſe, that could not diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>inſtructions,</hi> and <hi>canons; tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or mentioning matters, and confirming them by ſolemne act and decree.</hi> To reforme his errour therefore, I muſt let him vnderſtand, that the conuenticle of <hi>Florence</hi> did not by any ſolemne canon eſtabliſh the iuſt number of ſeuen ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but certaine idle Friers, or others in that conuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or at the leaſt vnder the credit thereof, deliuered this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſeuen ſacraments to the <hi>Armenians.</hi> Furthermore, not all Churches, but the <hi>Armenians</hi> had this doctrine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto them. I ſpeake therefore warily, where I ſay, <hi>that albeit that doctrine was talked of perhaps, and deliuered to the Armenians; yet it was firſt confirmed by ſolemne act of the conuenticle of Trent,</hi> and ſo receiued of as many, as liked that conuenticle. So I may ſay likewiſe, that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church concerning the ſubſiſtence of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents in the ſacrament without ſubiect was prated of, and debated in ſchooles before the conuenticle of <hi>Conſtance;</hi> but yet I may ſay alſo, that it was not receiued generally, nor by ſolemne act confirmed before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenticle of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> where Pope <hi>Iohn the</hi> 23. was depoſed for <hi>Sodomitrie, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme,</hi> and other grieuous and enormous crim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s in the actes of that aſſembly recorded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he would gladly finde ſome contradiction in my wordes, <hi>for that pag.</hi> 21. <hi>I ſay,</hi> as he ſetteth it downe, <hi>that the opinion of Luther concerning the real preſence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth not any fundamentall point of faith, and yet pag.</hi> 54.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18442:154"/> 
                  <hi>of my Challenge, affirme, that the Papiſts holding tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation doe bring in Eutychianiſme, teaching that Chriſts body is in the ſacrament without viſible ſhape, or true dimenſion, or circumſcription;</hi> which as <hi>Leo</hi> teacheth <hi>ſerm.</hi> 6. <hi>de ieiunio</hi> 7. <hi>menſis,</hi> is flat <hi>Eutychianiſme.</hi> But he ſtriueth in vaine to force contradiction out of theſe wordes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for papiſts may wel be <hi>Eutychianiſts,</hi> and yet not <hi>Luther,</hi> as I beléeue, they tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that the ſubſtance of bread is aboliſhed in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (of which followeth <hi>Eutyches</hi> his errour) and <hi>Luther</hi> holding the contrarie. For if the bread be aboliſhed, and the ſacrament is like to the perſon of Chriſt, conſiſting of two natures; then it followeth, that as bread remaineth not in the ſacrament after conſecration, ſo Chriſts humanitie is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed after the vnion of the two natures: which is flatte <hi>Eutychianiſme.</hi> Further, he was a ſimple fellow, to leaue a charge of <hi>Eutychianiſme</hi> vpon the Papiſts, vpon a ſmal hope of taking me in contradiction. Indéede I confeſſe, he deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it in termes, and ſaith, <hi>that Chriſts body in the ſacrament is not without ſhape, and true dimenſions.</hi> He ſhould alſo haue ſaid <hi>circumſcription,</hi> if he would haue auoided the note of <hi>Eutychianiſme.</hi> but if that be ſo, he diſchargeth me of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. But in the meane while, he ſheweth himſelfe to be ignorant of the ſtate of his owne cauſe, and very impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to ſay, <hi>that Chriſt his body hath all his true dimenſions, and ſhape in the ſacrament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> which at large is diſprooued in my treatiſe <hi>de miſſa</hi> againſt <hi>Bellar.</hi> Finally, going about to take me in contradiction, like a falſarie hee doth alter my wordes, and peruert my meaning. For I ſay onely, <note place="margin">Reply pag. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>that Luthers and Caluins priuat opinions, concerning either princes ſoueraigne authoritie, or the real preſence concerne not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points of faith.</hi> And my reaſon is firſt, for that our faith is not built on priuat mens opinions, as the faith of the papiſts, that are bound to beléeue all the determinations of euery Pope, that doe concerne the faith. And ſecondly, for that <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion is not hereticall in it ſelfe, and as it may be expounded, but by inference of ſuch concluſions as follow of it.</p>
               <p>His thirde ſuppoſed contradiction is forced out of my
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18442:155"/> wordes, where I ſay, <hi>that the Fathers make againſt Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> and yet ſéeme, <hi>to make Gelaſius and Gregorie Papiſts, that liued aboue a thouſand yeares agone.</hi> But herein is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contradiction, nor repugnance. For firſt it will not be proued, that either <hi>Gregorie</hi> or, <hi>Gelaſius</hi> maketh for <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> in their authenticall writings. <hi>Secondly,</hi> theſe two are not for antiquity or learning to be compared to <hi>Hierome,</hi> or <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> or the Fathers, that liued in their time, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Finally,</hi> albeit the dialogues, that go vnder the name of <hi>Gregorie,</hi> or the decrée of <hi>Gelaſius C. ſancta diſt.</hi> 15. did ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the pumpe of Poperie, and fopperie; yet that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing for the papiſts. For it ſhall neuer be proued, that <hi>Gregorie</hi> did write ſo foppiſh fables and lies as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in his dialogues; nor that <hi>Gelaſius</hi> did indéede ſet downe all that decree, that is reported <hi>C. ſancta. diſt.</hi> 15. eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially that of lying and fabulous legends. Neither, if in any one point, or ceremony <hi>Gregorie,</hi> or <hi>Gelaſius</hi> doth differ from vs; is he therefore to be reputed to ſpeake wholy for the papiſts. But ſaith <hi>Owlyglaſſe, we may as truely inferre, that ſeeing the proteſtants doe with great applauſe admit the actes of their holy Martyres written by M. Foxe, they receiue fabulous martyrologies, and lying legends, as it is inferred that Papiſts receiue fabulous martyrologies and lying legends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but the caſe is ſo vnlike, as <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> though a ridiculous fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is vnlike to <hi>Gelaſius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> for neither doe we reade our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrologies in churches, as the papiſts doe their legends; nor doe we beléeue them as grounds of faith, as the papiſts doe their legendicall traditions, nor doth M. <hi>Foxe</hi> report any ſuch abominable and ridiculous fables, as are contained in the Romiſh legends. But all this notwithſtanding if <hi>Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyglaſſe</hi> will impudently ſtill compare our martyrologies with the lying legends; let him ſhew, if he can, where M. <hi>Foxe</hi> telleth tales of men walking without heads, talking without tongues, paſſing the ſea without ſhippes, going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, reſtoring of birdes to life, of a cowe bellowing being boyling in a cauldron, of remoouing mountaines and ſuch like, as are in the legends very common, and muſt be beléeued as eccleſiaſtical traditions.</p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:18442:155"/>
               <p>His fourth obſeruation is, <hi>that it were a point of ſome cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to gueſſe by my writings, of what religion I am.</hi> But it is a point of ſmall cunning to gueſſe, that <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> is a man of no religion, making no conſcience to ſnatch at any thing, that may ſerue his turne, though neuer ſo falſe; to lie, to falſifie, to rayle at all, that are not of his damned humor. If any religion he haue, it is ſome reliques of poperie, which he notwithſtanding is neither well able to vnderſtand, nor any way to defend. A religion (if we may call faction a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) moſt fond, foppiſh, abſurd, vaine, ſuperſtitious, falſe and impious, as partly in this treatiſe is declared, and ſhall God willing more at large be declared other-where. As for my ſelfe I doe him to wit, that I am a Chriſtian, and a true Catholike, beleeuing the Apoſtolike faith, and profeſſing the ſame, as it is ſet downe in the Apoſtles créede, in the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of faith publiſhed in the foure firſt generall councels, and in the créede of <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> I doe alſo beléeue whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is expreſſed in holy canonicall ſcriptures, or may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of them, and I doe deteſt all popiſh ſuperſtition, blaſphemy, hereticall abhominations, and all other hereſies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> might well haue vnderſtood by all the courſe of my writings, if he had read them, or would or could vnderſtand them. But ſaith <hi>Owlyglaſſe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Page, 110.</note> 
                  <hi>on the one ſide, reaſon there is, to thinke him a conformable proteſtant, &amp;c.</hi> Afterward he talketh his pleaſure <hi>of new Geneua Iigs, and of harmony puritanicall.</hi> Which courſe of rayling, if he doe continue, there is good hope, that to accorde with this Iigge, he may ere it be long, ſing a baſe <hi>de profundis</hi> at <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne.</hi> To the matter I anſwere, that in <hi>England,</hi> albeit there hath béene ſome difference betwéene priuat perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ceremonies and gouernment, and that without diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréement in religion; yet now all that quarrell, to the great griefe of <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> and his conſorts is ended, and all godly chriſtians iointly concurre to the repreſſing of the ſeditious maſſeprieſts, and their adherents, that by faction, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſeeke to vndermine both the Church, and ſtate.</p>
               <p>In this obſeruation he goeth about alſo to prooue, that I doe not ſéeme to allow the doctrine eſtabliſhed in this church
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18442:156"/> of England. But as in the reſt, ſo in this <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> doth but trifle. I doe holde, I confeſſe, <hi>that baptiſme is not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, but that diuers may, and haue beene ſaued without it, eſpecially where there is no contempt committed in procuring it.</hi> Further I doe beléeue, <hi>that it is vnlawfull for women to take vpon them to adminiſter baptiſme;</hi> and doe aduiſe in caſe of extremitie all chriſtians to procure the miniſters preſence. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I doe vtterly condemne the doctrine of the papiſtes concerning their <hi>limbus patrum. Fourthly,</hi> I doe much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like their ſuperſtitious ſtationary obambulations about the limits of pariſhes for the bleſſing of new corne, and their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious letanies and ceremonies vſed in the fame. <hi>Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> I deny, that euer the catholike church had any precepts, or canons to forbid mariages on ſuch daies, and in ſuch ſort, and for ſuch reſpects, as the Romiſh Church doth practiſe. <hi>Sixtly,</hi> I doe beléeue, that <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion abſolutely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in it ſelfe is not a fundamentall point of religion, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if we giue his wordes a fauourable conſtruction. <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> I accompt none to be true chriſtians and profeſſours, that make no conſcience of ſinne, and liue not according to their profeſſion. But what of all this? doe I therefore teach contrarie to any point of doctrine maintained by the church of England? ſo <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> my good friend would inſinuate. But his proofes are ſimple, and his aſſertions moſt falſe. He ſaith, <note place="margin">Page, 111.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Church of England teacheth, that baptiſme is neceſſarie to ſaluation.</hi> But the booke, which he alleadgeth, out of which he cannot bring one word to prooue his ſaying, doth conuince him both of lying, and impudencie. <hi>Secondly</hi> he affirmeth, <hi>that to deny womens baptiſme is contrarie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion eſtabliſhed.</hi> But it is not contrarie to his religion to lie and face out lies moſt impudently. <hi>Thirdly</hi> to prooue, that our church beléeueth <hi>limbus patrum,</hi> he ſhould haue allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our confeſſion, and not a certaine verſet of the créede in méeter. Beſide that, in that verſet nothing is ſaid, <hi>but that Chriſt illuminated thoſe, that ſate in darkneſſe;</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to <hi>limbus patrum,</hi> a place, that cannot be illuminated, as papiſtes holde. Further, that verſet may be rather an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the words of the ſong of <hi>Zacharie,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>of the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18442:156"/> of the ignorant,</hi> and of the like wordes of the Prophet <hi>Eſay chap.</hi> 9. then an aſſertion of <hi>limbus pactum. Fourthly,</hi> the papiſts in their perambulations of pariſhes vſe to bleſſe, or rather to exorciſe corne, and to ſay moſt wicked <hi>litanyes.</hi> They vſe alſo diuers ſuperſtitious ceremonies, which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>Owlyglaſſe</hi> prooue to be allowed by our Church, he will prooue himſelfe a cogging compagnion. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> he talketh of prohibitions of the ſolemnizations of mariages at certaine times; but he alleadgeth neither lawe, nor record to prooue, that our Church alloweth either the doctrine, or the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> congregation in this point. And there, whither he ſendeth vs, we finde nothing, but the teſtimonie of an Almanacke. <hi>Sixtly,</hi> albeit the church of England doth not holde <hi>Luthers</hi> real preſence of Chriſtes body in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, yet cannot the detractor ſhewe, but that his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be reconciled with the Chriſtian faith, if a man will not vrge thoſe points, that follow of that doctrine too ſeuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and further percaſe, then at the firſt <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them. If a man doe gather what doth followe of it, then is the doctrine dangerous, as I and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe.</p>
               <p>Finally, he doth not ſo much as go about to ſhewe, that I haue deliuered any thing contrary to the doctrine of our Church, where I affirme, that good life is as well required in a true profeſſour, as true faith. Why then is this point touched in this place? Doth it grieue him, that I touch the filthy <hi>Sodomiticall</hi> prieſts, and friers, and ſhut that abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable generation out of Gods church? It ſéemeth ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore to requite me, he ſaith, <hi>that this doctrine may touch me, for that I haue falſified and maliciouſly corrupted the fathers.</hi> But if I haue cleared my ſelfe of all thoſe matters, that he hath laide to my charge; I hope the vanitie of his collection will manifeſtly appeare to all indifferent men. But hee poore ideot, appeareth not: but ſéeing the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and diuers of her principall pillers to be charged with notorious lies and <hi>falſifications,</hi> paſſeth away in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and is not able to anſwere one worde. Nay, hee leaueth his clients in the briers, and ſignifieth, for ought
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18442:157"/> he can doe, they muſt pleade for themſelues.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to leaue off further to vrge this diſtreſſed fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that is able to ſay nothing for the defence of them, whom he doth principally fauour, I may well conclude, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the arguments which I brought in my Challenge ſtand immooueable, and the detectors exceptions are prooued to be vaine, and friuolous, <hi>firſt,</hi> that the Romiſh church is not the true Church of Chriſt Ieſus. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the religion of Papiſts, is neither auncient, nor catholike, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that all papiſts maintaining the doctrine of the Pope, and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, are heretikes. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that ſuch as embrace po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh religion, are idolaters. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> that all the Popes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents and agents that haue ſuffered for his cauſe in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, are to be reputed no better, then diſloyall traytors, and not, as ſome would haue it, Martyres. <hi>Finally,</hi> that my aduerſary by his friuolous obiections hath much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and ſtrengthened our cauſe, againſt which he was not able to obiect any one thing of moment; and iuſtified my allegations, being not able to take any iuſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt any thing ſaid by me, nor to obiect any thing, which is not fully anſwered.</p>

The qualitie of <hi>mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſnes</hi> and <hi>wilfulneſſe</hi> being a matter purpoſed, and fully promiſed, he vtterly forgot. In the reſt how poorely he hath demeaned himſelfe, by my anſwere to his whole diſpute it will appeare, But ſuppoſe I had either miſtaken a report, miſalleadged a place; yet that is nothing to the cauſe, which by priuat mens errors cannot be eyther charged, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiced.</p>
               <p>But if the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom the papiſts flie in all controuerſies and extremities commit falſifications; then is the cauſe of poperie quite ruined, and ouerthrowne. For he is <hi>the</hi>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18442:158"/> her. If both the Pope himſelfe, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doe deliuer vnto vs lyes, and fables; then is the pope no vpright iudge, but a lying hypocrite, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the true Church, nor a miſtris of truth, but a miſtreſſe of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and lyes.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore ſée whether the pope or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may not in this poynt be more iuſtly charged then we, and whether they be cleare of this fault or no. For that is a point farre more materiall, then any thing, which the aduerſary can deuiſe againſt vs. Let vs alſo conſider how <hi>Bellarmine</hi> &amp; <hi>Baronius</hi> and others the Popes agents haue acquited them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their narrations, and allegations. For ſo it may beſt appeare, how vnaduiſedly this detector began his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. our aduerſaries being ſo notorious offenders in telling vntruthes, and committing moſt groſſe and wicked forgeryes, and wée ſo cleare and innocent, at the leaſt from all willfulneſſe violence and malice, if not from error.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow I come to <hi>Robert Parſons, alias Coobuck,</hi> a man, I confeſſe, vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bee ioyned with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> being farre inferiour to them in learning; yet in regard of his falſehood and treacherous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, comparable with the moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ſhameleſſe <hi>Iebuſite</hi> of the whole order, and with the moſt falſe packer of all the popiſh faction. His ſcholers beléeue, that he is learned. but if his trecherous complots and packings were not more to be feared, then his learning; he were not to be reputed halfe ſo dangerous, as we finde him. The which, albeit I meant not here to diſpute, being without the reatch of my purpoſe; yet becauſe I would not haue euery ſuch woodden fellow, as <hi>Philip Woodward alias Owlyglaſſe</hi> (for ſo men call the author of the detectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) to take exceptions vnto my ſayings, as deſtitute of proofe, I will briefly verifie in this place; and that by two of his bookes, which his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers for learning &amp; workmanſhip beléeue to be ſingular. If any man néede any further trial; he may, if he pleaſe, read my reply to his wardword, where I haue ſounded his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be very ſhallow.</p>
               <p>The firſt of the two is entituled, <hi>a briefe diſcourſe contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18442:200"/> certaine reaſons, why</hi> (papiſts, whom falſely he termeth) <hi>Catholikes refuſe to go to Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and this booke <hi>Parſons</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the maske of <hi>Iohn Howlet,</hi> a fit name for ſuch a night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bird, doth preſume moſt impudently to offer to her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. The next is called <hi>a chriſtian directory,</hi> and commonly knowne by the name of <hi>Parſons his reſolution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His former diſcourſe is wholy grounded vpon this rotten foundation, <hi>that the popiſh religion</hi> (which the Iebuſiticall faction and their followers, by all their witte, learning, and other meanes ſéeke to promote) <hi>is the true Catholike religion.</hi> This being the foundation of the worke, if he had béene a wiſe builder, he would haue confirmed, and proued ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that her Maieſty, before whom he pleadeth, might haue conceiued well of his cauſe, and allowed of his reaſons. but alleadging no one word to prooue this, the whole worke doth not onely fall to the ground, but alſo miniſtreth matter, that may be turned backe vpon himſelfe, and employed to the hurt and preiudice of his clients. For as it is a good reaſon, if the popiſh religion be the true chriſtian religion, to mooue men to refuſe all religions oppoſite vnto it, ſo if the ſame be falſe, odious, trecherous, damnable; then neither haue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts any reaſon to profeſſe it, nor others to beare with thoſe, that obſtinately defend it. but I haue ſhewed, that it is not onely new, and falſe, but alſo ſuperſtitious and hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. Againe, if <hi>Parſons</hi> can ſay nothing, why the religion profeſſed in England, is not Catholike and apoſtolical; then all his reaſons fall to the ground, and all his pretenſes of feare of infection, of ſcandale, of ſchiſme, of caſting away the marke of diſtinction, of participation with vs, of diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, of naughty ſeruice, of the benefit of popiſh religion may be retorted againſt himſelfe and his clients. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are Chriſtians to ſuffer the practiſe of the idolatrous maſſe, nor the faction and packing of wicked diſſembling pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; nor may any magiſtrate or other good chriſtian with good conſcience, ſuffer Gods true religion by ſchiſmatickes and heretickes to be ſcorned. And theſe reaſons are ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, that I doubt not, but thoſe that haue the managing of theſe cauſes, will both take vp ſuch <hi>Howlets,</hi> and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:18442:200"/> Chriſtian religion from contempt of ſuch impoſtors, and Atheiſtes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> purpoſing, and promiſing <hi>three things,</hi> whereof the firſt was <hi>a demonſtration of reaſons, why Papiſts ſhould not goe to the Church,</hi> the next contained <hi>a declaration of meanes how papiſts ſhould remedy, or eaſe themſelues of their afflictions,</hi> the <hi>third</hi> was <hi>an inſtruction how with patience to endure affliction:</hi> the firſt he handleth moſt lewdly and looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. the other two parts he was not able to make out, abuſing both his friends and his aduerſaries with his falſe promiſes. Further, it may be, that his remedies were nothing, but practiſes of treaſon and rebellion, and that he meant nothing leſſe, then to exhort men to patience: and that therefore he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſpeake of theſe two points. But why then did he promiſe? doth he promiſe that, which hee purpoſeth not to performe? and doth he meane to kéepe no touch in any thing?</p>
               <p>His directory alſo is a moſt idle and vaine diſcourſe. It ſhould conſiſt of thrée partes, whereof the firſt, as he ſaith, <hi>appertaineth to reſolution, the ſecond treateth of entrance, the third of perſeuerance.</hi> but as his faſhion is, of thrée partes promiſed, he kéepeth backe two, and performeth the third moſt ſimply. For <hi>firſt,</hi> that which he hath written concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning reſolution is very impertinent. for it is a very euil ſigne of reſolution in matters of chriſtian religion, for a man to diſpute, <hi>whether there be a God or no, and whether chriſtian religion be true or no:</hi> as <hi>Parſons</hi> doth. Againe, <hi>deſpaire of Gods mercy, temptations, feare of perſecution,</hi> and ſuch like impediments, as <hi>Parſons</hi> alleadgeth, doe rather hinder a man to leade a chriſtian life, then helpe to reſolue him to doe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the greateſt part of his diſcourſe, is either ſtollen out of <hi>Gaſpar Loarti,</hi> or <hi>Granatenſis,</hi> or <hi>Stella,</hi> or ſuch like fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er like and idle diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it argueth, that he hath a bad conceit of popiſh ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colikes in England. for if he tooke them to be chriſtians, he would neither go about to teach them, that there is a God, nor that chriſtian religion is true, nor that there are rewards
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18442:201"/> offered to thoſe that doe well, both in the life to come, and in this life, and puniſhments likewiſe for euill doers both in this life, and after this life. for euery childe among chriſtians knoweth all this without his teaching.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> we doe not finde, that this directory hath made any one chriſtian, or directed him the way to life. But I doe heare many complaine, that diuers ſimple young men haue béen directed by him to the gallowes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> it ſhould ſéeme, that this booke hath wrought lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good effect in <hi>Parſons</hi> himſelfe, that hauing ſo long ſtood vpon reſolution, is not yet come <hi>to the entrance of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as lawes are made to reſtraine common abuſes, ſo likewiſe divines ſhould diſcourſe of ſuch matters, as may make moſt for reformation of chriſtian mens manners. This diſcourſe therefore of his, wherein he endeuoureth to prooue, <hi>that there is a God, that there is one true religion, that there is a heauen, and a hell,</hi> among chriſtians already well perſwaded is impertinent, and woulde better haue béene beſtowed vpon <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniardes,</hi> that ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in God, or know any of the principall points of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, intreating of <hi>reſolution,</hi> which as himſelfe declareth, goeth before <hi>entrance,</hi> and <hi>perſeuerance;</hi> yet doth he very wiſely diuide the treatiſe of <hi>reſolution</hi> into ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and practiſe. <hi>The firſt part</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall containe matter of diſcourſe, ſpeculation, conſideration; the ſecond ſhall handle things appertaining to exerciſe, vſe and practiſe.</hi> As if a man could practiſe, that is not entered into the exerciſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or as if reſolution were not farre different from practiſe.</p>
               <p>Finally, the booke is ſo full fraught with idle diſcourſes, and the principall points ſo weakely proued, that it will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make Chriſtians to doubt of religion, then Atheiſtes to beleeue. It doth alſo containe ſo much poyſon, that no phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke can make it holeſome.</p>
               <p>I would therefore aduiſe all Chriſtians to beware of his booke <hi>of reſolution</hi> by him intituled <hi>a directorie,</hi> containing
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18442:201"/> little truth, but much ſuperſtition and hereticall poyſon. The ſame is alſo a diſgrace to all papiſtes, whome he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth as yet not to be reſolued, that there is a God, or that chriſtian religion is true. To chriſtians it can yeelde no inſtruction being a packe of ſtollen and bad ſtuffe euill truſſed together. Neither is the ſame good, although it hath béene purged, the whole ſubſtance being leud, and full of poyſon. Much I wonder, that any chriſtian would ſette it forth in this Church, and more, that chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſhould beleeue, that any good was like to come of ſuch a wicked writing. And I doubt not, but that ſuch as are in authority will remoue both that, and other ſuch venemous treatiſes out of all true Chriſtian mens handes, being rather fit for Italian atheiſtes, then the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh nation.</p>
               <p>To leaue the reſt of his treacheries, hereſies and other faults; which are rather to be corrected by the publike exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quutioner, then noted by the ſtile of a writer, I will only in this diſcourſe ſet downe certaine notorious falſifications committed by him in ſundry pamphlets ſet out vnder diuers counterfect names, and giue you a taſt of his vnſauory lies, of which in <hi>Parſons</hi> writinges there is great ſtore. And this ſo much the rather, for that in his relation ſent vs from Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, concerning the conference ſome two yeares agone paſſed in France betwéene Monſieur <hi>de pleſſis,</hi> and the pretended bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Eureux,</hi> he ſéemeth earneſtly <hi>to deſire a triall concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe points.</hi> The man alſo in his preface before his reaſons of refuſall of going to the Church, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Iohn Houlet</hi> deſireth <hi>that ſome indifferent triall may be had either by diſputation or otherwiſe:</hi> wherein I deſire he ſhould be ſatiſfied.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">falsification </seg>1</label> Firſt then I challenge the man, as a notorious falſificator, in that he hath ſet forth his owne booke concerning titles vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of another preiſt called <hi>Dolman,</hi> who was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer acquanted with the matter.
